see some example sources for notability I added to the Talk page. Inc. Magazine says "perhaps the best known of several groups that emerged during the 1990s to offer educational opportunities and other kinds of support to young business owners" in their encyclopedia entry (which is apparently sourced from a business copywriting company but check and see what you think). Time magazine lists the organization as a columnist. Reports of chapters in Japan (since 1995) and Russia (since 2003) (when the organization was still called "Young Entrepreneurs' Organization") are easy to find. With a 1987 founding, there's little news to report, so I'd expect that sources are going to either be old (so also check offline) or about local chapters/events. But again, notability is not the problem. 	1

see Category:Community gardening in the United States and Category:Community gardening in England. One option would be to develop city or regional level topics and break them out of national-level topics. Where there are articles about individual gardens, perhaps sometimes those should be merged to a city or regional level topic. The general development should be discussed elsewhere. About this particular article, I think Montanabw should have discussed at the Talk page, where i had opened discussion, first. This is an unnecessary escalation, expanding conflict, IMHO. But, since the AFD is started, I assume it will carry on.  To Montanabw and to Pigsonthewing, have you performed wp:BEFORE. What about looking into what I said at the Talk page, previously? What about the state of the article, with sources, before? As I noted at the Talk page previously was that the article "was substantially better than it is now. A non-logged-in editor removed a lot of sourced material in 2013 in this big diff of a few edits, with no explanation in edit summaries or otherwise. The article previously had several sources, and had a history going back to 1927. I removed a PROD proposal that would have deleted it quickly, which would be somewhat justified based on the poor current condition. But based on its previous state and sources, I tend to think it may be a Wikipedia-notable topic. It should be developed not deleted." I also add the WikiProject Louisiana template and may post at the wikiproject." I vote "Keep" for now, on the basis that this should be developed, and/or could be merged into some new regional article or some new schools-based community gardens article. Development should be under auspices of some group of community garden-interested editors, not sure where that is yet. Multiple attacks on separated articles is not the best way forward for developing Wikipedia in this area. I will now also notify Wikiproject Louisiana and Wikiproject NOLA. By the way, entirely jokingly, at User talk:RexxS#â€ŽCommunity gardening in the West Midlands, i jokingly suggested that all two of the community gardens articles in England could be forcibly merged into a new article at the England level, and that a Community gardens in the West Midlands article could be created too. I was joking	1

 Please forgive me if my syntax is rough. I am very new to this. The album Spirit And Truth was the very first album ever released by Hillsong, and it was only released on cassette and if I remember correctly it was simply sold locally by the church at that time, which was much smaller than it is today. There probably will not be any online sources to find on the album for this reason, however there could be offline sources on the album. Maybe we could try to cover that ground as best we can before going forward with a delete	1

 Let me first say that I can overlook the band's titling of this album as the internet bubble was just kicking off, but now with the age of Google, bands should never title an album using a very commonly used verb, especially one that they may end up using (as MercyMe did) in a song title later	1

 Keep (see keep reasoning below) - I found a television news broadcast by FOX News (which I am not entirely certain I can call a "reliable source", but am willing to treat it as an impartial one here) which features the Christian women of Joshua House in Stafford, TX who own and run the business that produces this product, though the news broadcast never actually mentions the words "Young Living" in it, only the words "essential oils" (all of which, in the broadcast, are clearly marked Young Living Essential Oils). If the spot had somehow been a paid-for piece, it would have mentioned the product by name, which it did not. Another FOX news piece (also originally a television spot, it looks like, this time from Oklahoma City) about essential oils that mentions Young Living in passing once. According to this, the founder may be a quack, but that is neither here nor there. Next was a press release in the Fort Francis Times (not independent, can't be used), then a passing mention in an eMissourian article about a local farmer's market, and then a mention in the Colchester Calendar of the Truro Daily News about the Truro Christian Women's Club presentation on the oils at a continental breakfast at Bible Hill (along with crochet meetings, seniors' dances, quilt show, and a bluegrass festival). To me, this does not appear to add up to bona fide notability, though I think it may be a borderline case against it (the first of the two FOX News broadcasts is the &lt;cringe&gt	1

Pull your forward hand back hard!"      "Americans have a terrible time; they always want to hunch their shoulder and wind up for punches and duck." In karate, instead of dodging, you block.   I highly disagree that the article only gives a "passing mention." The entire article is the reporter's detailed description of what he sees, feels and is taught by Min Pai at the Yun Mu Kwan Karate Institute.In answer to your concern that "the school/art has 1 teacher who does all kung fu classes and no locations outside of NYC", I have added a new section listing four schools that are currently teaching versions of Min Pai's Nabi Su style. All of these schools share the same history, all are independently run, and none of them are currently associated with each other. There are a few other people teaching the style, but I am not authorized to list their schools. I imagine now that a list is created, others may expand it. Thank you for suggesting this improvement.As to the fact that I have made few other contributions, yes, this is my first article, and I will be writing/collaborating on more articles. This is not my only interest. It is my first article and I will continue improving it and defending it.

see the rather crude "Mr. potato head" style photofits on this page for instance and the repeated recreation of Thomas Rathnam, a supposed descendent. I don't doubt this is a real person but that isn't helping to find sources and means we need to be particularly vigilant about verification in this case. I have no idea what the Tamil script is saying in the article that is supposedly the Tamil version of his name (Google translate comes up with nothing intelligble), but the shear length of it makes it pretty certain that it does not say "S.V.S. Rathinam". From the cover of his book I summise that "S.V.S. Rathinam" is "à®Žà®¸à¯. à®µà®¿. à®Žà®¸à¯. à®‡à®°à®¤à¯à®¤à®¿à®©à®®à¯" in Tamil. Hence I offer   Find sources:&#160;"à®Žà®¸à¯. à®µà®¿. à®Žà®¸à¯. à®‡à®°à®¤à¯à®¤à®¿à®©à®®à¯"&#160;â€“&#160;news&#160;Â· newspapers&#160;Â· books&#160;Â· scholar&#160;Â· highbeam&#160;Â· JSTOR&#160;Â· free images&#160;Â· wikipedia libraryHowever, not seeing anything useful there, so no easily accessible sources in Tamil either. Further, I think the major claim to importance of converting 10,000 christians is dubious. The article later says that he assisted Di Elbreil to convert 10,000. I am presuming that is the same 10,000. 	1

And I fully believe that she was there and that she did negotiate with the rebels and nobody ever bothered to write about this incredible thing she did partly because she was just a nun (more systemic bias).

 Thank you. First, the OCLC and the eISSN were both incorrect in the article. I just corrected them. I had no problem locating this journal in Worldcat. I found no Russian libraries listed though, mostly libraries around the US, and some in the UK and Germany. (Remember, it only lists holdings in participating libraries.) Here's my search result: [4] Or go to the article now and click the OCLC link.                          I understand what you are saying about the limitations of IC and Worldcat, but that doesn't exclude them as RS. They themselves are notable, reliable, and independent. I presume Worldcat, despite its limitations, is notable, reliable, and independent because it is recommended in the consensus-based NJournals. IC is certainly notable because the editorial boards of 10,409 journals actually have gone through their submission process, reliable meaning there seems to be no reason to think they are academically dubious or dishonest - they list their methods clearly - and I think it's a stretch to think they would be unreliable if 10,409 journals are laying their credibility on the line by actively requesting inclusion and ICV evaluation, and independent in that they have designed their review and scoring methodology independent of Problems of Onomastics. (It looks like a few journals might be gaming the scoring though. I doubt the Journal of Onomastics is though, because they do not mention their score on their website.) These sources are at least something. This is a Russian language humanities journal. Indexing in that field is going to be different from indexing in the natural sciences. Worldcat and IC give reason for me to think this journal is most likely notable (and in themselves possibly satisfying notability on their own, per NJournals, in the minds of some editors), and that someone can find RS to answer the question directly. (Personally I very much prefer structured abstracts. It prevents rambling essays like my posts here, making them more readable.)                          You ask "what is the policy-based reason to keep this?" I think that is the question that turns WP: Deletion Policy on its head.

Consider this case in Ireland which concerns a University of Limerick lecturer who assaulted a student in a football match. The lecturer was later fined â‚¬1000,000. Now it's all too easy to assume it was the lecturer who made the application. But in fact if you go to the original article, you can see the student was named and had expressed dismay at the size of the payout. He would have preferred a nominal sum of damages and a proper apology instead. It's quite within the bounds of possibility that it was the student himself who made the take-down application, worrying perhaps about the effect the publicity would have on his career, possibly even the fact that he hd come into a substantial sum of money. As article 96 of the Costeja ruling makes it clear, it is not necessary that the information is prejudicial to the applicant. The same for the countless cases of victims of sexual assault linked by name by Google: many would no doubt want their details removed. Likewise the victims of so-called revenge pornography. That is not yet illegal in all EU jurisdictions and the victims' only recourse is thus "right to be forgotten" (the ruling properly is that search engines are date controllers and must consider take-down requests).  The fact is that this list is a thoroughly poorly thought out proposition, good faith or otherwise, and should be deleted. RR 2014 (<a hr	1

 agree previous article incarnation was problematic, deserving of an AfD, but the problems have hopefully been fixed as per WP:HEYMANN, with bogus sources removed, promotional material excised, and better sources added. She is an interesting subject: a lawyer who gave up her practice to become a full-time underwater photographer, who teaches, gives talks, promotes healthy oceans and shark conservation, gave a TED talk, and her amazing photo was featured in Time magazine, plus her photo made the cover of this magazine. What is lacking are a few solid sources which delve substantively on her work (although there are a few with some depth); however, the WP:BASIC rule says "if the depth of coverage in any given source is not substantial, then multiple independent sources may be combined to demonstrate notability" and in this case, there are twenty-six (26) sources, and combining them one could make a case that it is sufficient to meet the GNG. While most sources are tangential, except perhaps for this one and this one, the overall picture which emerges is a fearless nature photographer who has an excellent eye for images and who is committed to underwater photography of a (to me) dangerous subject -- sharks, plus some land animals too like cheetahs (her photo made Yahoo	0

Thank you for your input on this article. Here is how I reached my assessment when putting together this article At first glance I would also agree with some of the comments when editing this topic, but as the person in question is not just known for academic work, Iâ€™m not so confident that an assessment can be solely based on this criteria. I based my decision on this: â€œHowever, academics, in the sense of the above definition, may also work outside academia (e.g., in industry, financial sector, government, as a clinical physician, as a practicing lawyer, etc.) and their primary job does not have to be academic in nature if they are known for their academic achievements	0

Thank you to Tokyogirl79 for providing the links to reliable sources and the context about the musical	0
Please note that her music has been broadcast on Iraqi Kurdish TV satellite channels many times. So she is quite well known even in Iraqi Kurdistan. If the main issue with the article is her court ruling then remove that part. We know that she is not Rojin, but that does not mean that she is unknown. Her music is traditional and folkloric and has nothing to do with politics. For instance her clip Le Buke is a famous folk song. Also not having a page in Turkish wikipedia is not a solid ground for deleting her article here. She sings in Kurdish not Turkish so it is reasonable to assume that she is not well known among Turks of Turkey. On the other hand, she does have an article in Kurdish wikipedia[48]. 	1

I have started this article very recently on 1st September and will certainly get round to developing it, and adding more relevant material (as already stated in my note/summary when I started this) --Im an old man now, and retired, and I have cardiac and diabetes problems, and maybe I cant hurry with my research and adding/developing articles with any fast speed. I hope you will please kindly grant me some time, in this respect, to develop this article at my own pace thanks. Secondly, The IDSM shouldnt be treated as a 'third award', its nothing to be sneezed at. As a military historian Im sure you must realise the value of this in the historical contexts? When it was instituted in 1907 it was the second highest award available to Indians, behind the Indian Order of Merit, however, when eligibility for the Victoria Cross was extended to cover all Commonwealth subjects in 1911, the IDSM became third highest in the order of precedence. It was instituted in order to recognise acts of gallantry that did not meet the standards required of the IOM. Its own unique value must be recognised. Also, I must thank here Col Mumtaz Khan who has added a small bibliography--to answer you, no, not all these three books mention Jemadar Latif Khan Tarin directly, only Brig Rizvi's history makes a decent mention	0

 Thank you for the clarification. I'm afraid that I'm rather new to Wikipedia, so I don't know all the jargon: what is a "PROD", please? and what are "maintenance tags"?As for the substance of the question . . . The problem with secondary or tertiary sources, limited to historical publications issued in paper formats, is that they often do not reflect current thinking about a topic. This is especially true of the music industry, in which much scholarship until recently was constrained because archival collections were inaccessible unless one happened to be in the right place with the right credentials. In my view, public databases or archives (such as the Indiana and Brown online resources I cited) are the 21st-century equivalent of secondary sources like published anthologies or encyclopedias in, let's say, 1965. In fact, they're better: they offer a much more objective, quantifiable measure of importanceâ€”and hence of notabilityâ€”than do historical studies written to further a particular argument and which thus (necessarily) take an editorial stance. I would suggest that if a publisher was responsible for a substantial body of significant music that is (nowadays) accessible to the public, as demonstrated in online archives, that publisher is "notable" and deserves an article. I'd also argue that if that publisher is noteworthy in part because his work contributed to the evolution of underrepresented regional or ethnic cultures in the United States, that further supports inclusion. D. W. Cooper meets both these criteria and should consequently remain in Wikipedia, it seems to me. As for an "essayish" tone, possibly that results from my inexperience. I'm very open to editorial advice; can you suggest what sentences or phrases impart this quality and how to improve them?I've not encountered this process of proposed deletion before; as I said, I'm rather new. It all seems rather threatening and inhospitable, I must say	0
 Thank you for the response and the suggestion, though I'm still not very clear about the deletion process. Isn't what you suggest effectively equivalent to deleting the page and starting again from the beginning for approval? I note that on the WP:USERFY page, section 3, this point is made explicitly: "Userfication of an article will effectively amount to deletion of an article, as in general, the redirect left behind will be speedily deleted. Userfication should not be used as a substitute for regular deletion processes." It would seem that the process you suggest to resolve this matter actually accomplishes what you apparently wish to have happen.I would also really like to have your comments on the substance of my responseâ€”that is, the matter of assessing notability using 21st-century resources rather than published secondary sources from a previous century. It seems that a potentially valuable discussion is being diverted into administrative mechanisms that neither resolve the immediate question nor allow larger issues to be debated. But perhaps there is a better forum for the latter	0

see Category:Former parks and open spaces of Londonâ€Ž and Category:Former places, which I believe includes many many many former buildings and structures, too. I think a former BC provincial park is likely unusual. Provincial or state or national parks are treated best like high schools, where we assume notability and it is not worth debating whether current sources are entirely satisfactory. For this park, there must have been legislation or other actions justifying a proposal, then creating the park and then eventually there must have been reasons to de-park it, say if it was destroyed environmentally and then deemed non-park-worthy. Perhaps it was renamed or subsumed into another park, in which case a redirect might be appropriate when it is sorted out. Whatever the story, it is surely documented somewhere (although apparently not on in sources easily found on the internet). Offline sources are fine. Keep this, like we automatically keep high schools. --	1

  Delete - Yes - as OA of the Jan Bogdan article - I *entirely* agree with the comments made above by User:Jdcrutch re deletion of the article - Enjoy!&#160;:) 	1
  Delete, at least on current evidence, with thanks and (I suspect) apologies to User:Drbogdan. The quotation he gave from the Jamestown Pioneers from Poland reference certainly goes some way to answering my question about what Wachtl said, and would seem to be reliable on that point. However, all its other mentions of Jan Bogdan occur in articles reprinted from other sources, which are basically popular accounts whose level of fact-checking would almost certainly not have reached the point of questioning an authentic-looking (though apparently not actually authentic) source like PamiÄ™tnik handlowca. And Robertson's Book of Firsts looks slightly less reliable still - the quote you give from it gives the publication date of Wachtl's Polonia w Ameryce as 1927 rather than (as both GScholar and the Polish Wikipedia article on Wachtl make clear) 1944, which Jamestown Pioneers from Poland gives as the date of a very similarly named publication by another author, two sentences away from a mention of Wachtl's book. Which leaves us with what we know of Wachtl and his source, Wiesci Polskie (for which 1831 to me looks like a more likely date than 1631 - let's just say that 1631 would a distinctly early date for a newsheet, and even more so for a Polish one published in London). Unfortunately, Google searches for Wiesci Polskie overwhelmingly produce results for a newspaper published between about 1940 and 1943, and even if I include one of the two earlier dates, the results show almost no evidence of an earlier publication of the same name (instead, one tends to end up with lists of publications which include both the 1940s newspaper and something from 1831 with quite a different title). And the only results which do clearly mention an 1831 or 1631 Wiesci Polskie are about Poles in early Virginia and, directly or indirectly, seem to refer back to Wachtl - and the only one of these that seems to add anything to this discussion is this one from a Polish museum. Unfortunately, what it does add is that the 1831 Wiesci Polskie "has eluded researchers", mention of a Polish scholar who produced a quite different (unsourced) list of names of Jamestown Poles, and a conclusion that "without having the original writings available, serious historians are unable to confirm that these were in fact the names of the Poles who came to Jamestown in 1608." With which I am regretfully forced to agree. (Having said all that, I would regard PamiÄ™tnik handlowca as notable, even as a hoax, and would not disagree with having this title redirecting there.) 	1

edit (a very nice and balanced US study, the full text of which is readily available through a google search), amongst several others. The article obviously should have a contextualising lead paragraph that indicates the significance of these narratives in the public debate over the use of ECT. It is a misnomer to argue for the inclusion or deletion of the list based upon its supposed scientific content. It really doesn't have any. The list is mostly of significance in terms of the history of the public debate about ECT and the way such personal narratives have been used to delegitimise or, more rarely, legitimise this particular therapy. Most of the list will be comprised of people who criticise the treatment and that, I think, accurately reflects much of the public debate on ECT, at least until recent times. Incidentally, one omission from the list of a proponent of ECT is the psychologist Martha Manning. 	0

Most lists on Wikipedia are and always will be "incomplete" in the sense that, as here, we have limited them to entries that have some connection to notable subjects rather than merely every thing of that type that has ever existed. And OR is only a reason to delete if the problem is unfixable, i.e., if it were unverifiable whether any songs are in fact about Miami.

let's just take one reference I looked at from the reviews section, [6], and it gives all of three sentences. Not once does it mention the show being on tour. And what is the reference linked to in the text? When Kooman's play was performed in the Montreal Fringe Festival alongside such other plays as The No Bullshit History of Canada and Fucking Stephen Harper: How I Sexually Assaulted the 22nd Prime Minister of Canada and Saved Democracy, the Montreal Gazette called She Has a Name a "well-crafted, issue-oriented play" that stood in contrast to the festival's "standup comedy, burlesque and navel-gazing solo shows". Exactly where does it say any of that? Answer	1

Keep - The article has a reference that indicates he made one appearance in the Primera for Colo-Colo (only because the club played an entire squad of reserves while the regular team competed in the Libertadores), but I don't think that's enough to make him notable without more evidence the article could satisfy the GNG but another reference indicates he appeared several times in the Primera for Colo-Colo and there is some coverage of his short spell with Jacksonville in the A-League (which possibly is fully-pro) so I think the GNG could be satisfied after all (this interview with El Mercurio is non-routine coverage, but doesn't indicate he's really noteworthy)	1

Rowland was a long-standing foreign correspondent for the BBC, and has won awards for her reporting with both the BBC and Al Jazeera English - major news organisations. She received a lot of praise for her reporting in Afghanistan and Yugoslavia. Her decision to testify against Milosevic received a lot of attention, it even seems to be a common case study in journalism ethics - take a look at a Google Books search to see this. This is not an "average" TV journalist, and even if she were "average" there is enough commentary on her over the years to satisfy WP:GNG. 	1

It is very clear that putting everything in conditional form (WP:ALLEGED) does not change that.  Rather than wikilawyering about the precise meaning of GNG, I would invoke WP:IAR which states that there are no rules, only guidelines, to avoid getting stuck in esoteric wikilawyering discussions when the issue at hand is clear to any child that has not learnt the guidelines.

Be careful of editors who WP:CHERRYPICK Wikipedia policies to support their statements	1
 Read the nomination reason, the issue is not Notability, so finding more sources to backup previously made statements does NOT make this article somehow more worthy of inclusion. The issue is that there isn't enough information in reliable secondary sources to warrant anything more than a dictionary definition. So, perhaps, a transwiki to Wiktionary would be appropriate, but a dictionary definition of a rarely used term is not appropriate for an encyclopedia. Yes, it was historically used in chemistry/medicine and may see some small uses today, but how does that translate into an article that can "minimally" meet the requirements of a stub	1

Delete. Pathegama has a GS profile, showing his works have been cited a bit more than last time this was up for AfD. However, the grand total (95 citations) and h-index (3) are miles below what we usually take as indicating notability at academics AfDs. There's a ton of links in the article, which is one of the most drummed-up puff pieces I have seen in a long time. Perhaps some of those links would make him pass GNG, but, frankly, there's too much to go through and the article is so bad, that even in the unlikely case that he meets GNG, WP:TNT applies. --	1

 Have just updated the article's references and citations to help support it further. For what it's worth, the peak period of this family and the Windsor repertory company was from the early 1930's to the early 1980's - consequently much of the supporting commentary is not available online. Does this discount it? the phrase "Windsor rep acting dynasty" was first used by John Counsell in his article "So Who Needs Subsidy, Anyway?" (Scottish Theatre, Inverkeithing, Scottish Theatre, Vol.2 No.3, May 1970) and was used regularly in the newspaper reviews (specifically the Windsor Express) and the theatre's programmes throughout the 70's and early 80's.    In terms of the significance of the family as a whole, the book "Counsell's Opinion" (by John Counsell, 1963) discusses it at great length, and the Genealogist's Magazine did a large feature on the family in 2002, connecting them with Hilary Tindall, John Loder and Roy Walker, and then did a follow-up in 2012 connecting them with Brice Stratford, James Stratford and Colin Jeavons. Jean Miller discusses the significance of the family as a whole in various interviews. Here is an illustrative excerpt from an interview with her for the British Library, in case you can't access any of them online: (Blakely, Emily "Theatre Archive Project: Interview with Jean Miller" British Library 14 May 2008)        Well, my sister was a scenic artist and my brother-in-law was a very famous art director in films ... He was put up for an Oscar for Ryanâ€™s Daughter. He made his name with Genevieve, I donâ€™t suppose youâ€™ve seen it? About the car who goes to Brighton. Itâ€™s a wonderful film. Anyway he made his name. Heâ€™d just come out of the Air Force when he made it and that was his first and it made his name. He did Fiddler on the Roof, all sorts of films, he worked for Disney, all sorts of things. So Michael acted, my brother-in-law was an art director, my sister was a scenic, my uncle and aunt were actors and directors, my two cousins were on the stage. Then Polly, my youngest daughter was until she had an accident. And her father-in-law - great grandfather-in-law...? grandfather-in-law	0

 Thank you Nixie for the feedback. Think I'm finally starting to understand the issue here. So you'd rather see this reference (http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324162304578304491492559684.html with the last section about Kitces's research on pegging withdrawals to stock valuations) rather than this reference (http://www.kitces.com/assets/pdfs/Kitces_Report_May_2008.pdf which is the actual research on pegging withdrawals to stock valuations)? In your view, the former is a reference, and the latter is "fluff"? The way I was taught in grad school was the exact opposite - third-party media discussions are "fluff" and real references go to the original source. I was actually trying NOT to include discussions like the WSJ reference on the research as that's pure fluff to me, but it sounds like your view is that that's the "right" kind of reference and the original source is not? I can certainly try to adjust it that way if that's what you've meant by "more encyclopedic" - to me, more encyclopedic meant more references to original sources, not fewer!	0

Verifiable Sources. While the datasheets *do*not* belong an encyclopedic article body... the datasheets *are* clearly professional, verifiable sources of information. 3. Neutral POV. This article has a neutral point of view. The article does not advocate for any particular entry of information. 4. Notability.

 Echo points as made by Candleabracadabra above. Sources are reputable UK newspapers and appeared in actual print. I suspect there will be many people (such as myself!) who wonder what "BRF" is, and will find it useful to read this article. It's also easy to find many sources of a similar quality. In response to concerns about "recentism", my reading of Wikipedia's guidance is that recentism has problems and benefits, and isn't an automatic reason to delete a page. (Notability can be an issue, but I think that in this case here.) I don't agree with the view that this article violates WP:WWIN. I don't think "unfunny" is a real Wikipedia policy objection, and surely it's better to deal with any BLP violations if and when they appear	0

Delete this garbage. But now I think from a purely information basis, it is factually interesting to know this group exists. Better to know than not to know, I think. But the entry should be rewritten so it isn't so supportive and there should never be any direct links to this group elsewhere on web. I'd put it on my watchlist to make sure this doesn't happen.

see Clarke's Laws and recall that G. Marconi, a key figure in the development of the radio, was recommended for the mental institution by the papal cleric to whom he applied for a grant to explore the possibility of wireless communications.  Here is a scan of an approving letter to Herndon from Inge Lehmann, whom Wikipedia informs us "received many honors for her outstanding scientific achievements, among them the Harry Oscar Wood Award (1960), the Emil Wiechert Medal (1964), the Gold Medal of the Danish Royal Society of Science and Letters (1965), the Tagea Brandt Rejselegat (1938 and 1967), the election as a Fellow of the Royal Society (1969),[3] the William Bowie Medal (1971, as the first woman), and the Medal of the Seismological Society of America (1977)": http://www.nuclearplanet.com/Inge%20Lehmann%20letter%20x600.jpg Please let's not let anonymous Wikipedia posters prematurely decide on the validity of Herndon's ideas, which as far as I can tell tend to be supported by a variety of coherent evidence, including the recent discovery of Jupiter-sized extrasolar planets in surprisingly close orbit about their suns. <a href="/w/i	1

see Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago. This subject has also received international attention and has other Wikipedia articles in other languages about him and this incident	1
see Here and Here and Here. The death of this subject received more media coverage in 2012 than the presidential election, happening in the same timeframe. The subject is also listed as Notable people sharing the surname "Martin" in a Wikipedia article which was added in this diff and is in the WP:CATEGORY of media related controversies in the United States. The death of the subject inspired a online petition that received over 2.2million signatures â€“ at that time (and to this date afaik), the largest number of signatures for any campaign in Change.org's history. There is still significant interest in the subject, as of September 16, 2013, Trayvon Martin (at redirect of SoTM) had been viewed over 3300 times. In addition to the six Wikipedia articles referenced above, the subject is also referenced on Angela Corey's WP article, by far having the biggest section on her page and Martin has a section on Sanford, Florida,s page as well. From the original article, Shooting of Trayvon Martin, there have also been these articles created as a result of the subjects death: Timeline of the shooting of Trayvon Martin - State of Florida v. George Zimmerman - Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago - George Zimmerman-which was just recently created. It stands to follow we should have an article on the deceased subject, instead of just references to the subject in numerous other Wikipedia articles. This article is meant to provide a historical biography of the entirety of the subject's life and inform the reader who this notable subject was prior to February 26, 2012. Additionally, it's in compliance with WP:BLP - WP:RS - WP:V - WP:NPOV - WP:NOTE - WP:TITLE -WP:IUP. Thank you for taking the time to read it.-- 	1

see this section's last paragraph regarding the amount of coverage in a source. Press releases, even if they are reprinted by sources unrelated to the production, are not considered independent." and "To presume notability, reliable sources should have significant coverage. Examples of coverage insufficient to fully establish notability include newspaper listings of screening times and venues, "capsule reviews", plot summaries without critical commentary, or listings in comprehensive film guides". Christian Film Guide[21] fails as insufficient to fully establish notablity. The Phoenix New Times link[22] is to its events calendar, and fails for that reason. It shouldn't even be used in the article where its 2 short paragraphs make up almost half the article (I suspect using this much, besides failing WP:UNDUE, may be copyvio, but I'll check). And the book Baby Boomer Rock 'n' Roll Fans: The Music Never Ends doesn't even mention the film although it is used as a source for the article. This seems to leave us with two sources, both I think probably meeting our criteria at WP:RS, Filmmaker (magazine) and Pitchfork Media. Maybe that would be enough to meet notability, but Filmmaker is actually just reproducing part of the article by Deusner, so it isn't really a 2nd source. This leaves us with only one reliable source with significant coverage, and I'm not sure that's enough. I am sure that if the article stays that we need to represent what Deusner actually says much better than we do now. 	1

 Delete (No need to&#160;!vote twice). Being on Big Brother doesn't necessitate a whole article for any housemate, let alone one that didn't even win the show. All information about the housemates can be found here in a handy little article: List of Big Brother Australia housemates (2013 series). The page in question has literally copy and pasted the information from the above page.    Tahan also hasn't attracted attention prior to Big Brother outside of some local newspaper articles which are very flimsy evidence to suggest any sort of fame or notability. "Several newspapers" is incorrect as it was one website that contained this information and was tabloid journalism - not a genuine, respected news source. These articles were written in a clearly promotional tone and aren't a proper representation of an actual proper newspaper.    I see no reason that this page should be kept as there is already a relevant page containing all of this information already. The only compromise I can see is merging the very small amount of extra info to the housemates page. If the actual winner of Big Brother (Tim) that has had a prior media career and is more well-known and well-liked than Tahan doesn't necessitate a whole page dedicated to him, then why does Tahan need one	1

So keep it. Good one. I do not care for any person's time being wasted to delete and re-create this article. If people do care for time being wasted to delete and re-create an article, they should open a RfC to abandon AfD, ProD and CSD processes. Coming back to the topic, Article is about a game released yesterday by a company, many person seem to be a fan of, doesn't meet notability standard. All sources, are "release-event-source". I would argue, people here are trying to establish one event notability. Yes, the game is notable for one event, for being released by the Sony Entertainment. Look, it is Abc news, and a game has been released or is about to release, by the company Sony Entertainment, and it follows all where as it is plague. Its feature made known by the company is, XXXX (page full, substantial coverage?). All sources do mention the same content, their ways	1
 Let's try to summarize the arguments here.    Keep: WP:GNG (significant coverage in reliable, independant sources)  Delete: WP:TOOSOON (unknown release date, not much to include yet), WP:SPECULATION (we can't tell yet whether the game itself will be notable)  Keep non-arguments: WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS (don't justify this article by comparing it to others), WP:NOTINHERITED (the fact that the game is by Sony is not enough to make it deserve an article)  Delete non-arguments: WP:NOTNEWS (the article is not about an event but a game, the fact that sources are recent and mainly written with the same press release as primary source is not related)      Feel free to argue if you disagree with this. Anyway, at this point, I'll say the gist of the debate is: can we can safely assume, from the existing sources, that the game itself will be notable	1

have a look, for example, at what is going on in Venezuelan schools, where a Cuban curriculum is mandated.  How Maduro is interfering in Venezuelaâ€™s schools ... However, their main concern is that the new regulation takes power away from parents and school authorities, and opens the door for political actors to use schools as places for propaganda. Experts agree, pointing to the slanted nature of some of the textbooks currently being distributed. They point, for example, to an illustrated copy of the constitution that is being sent to many schools in which Hugo ChÃ¡vez himself is portrayed as a quasi-religious figure along with Simon BolÃ­var. The pictures show ChÃ¡vez teaching children and NicolÃ¡s Maduro standing next to the actual text of the constitution ...  There are many other examples ... the spin around the "coup" of 2002, the notion that the US was involved, etc.' and the article should be/could be expanded to cover more of them. The now defunct Venezuela Information Office was a key part of the campaign in earlier years, and their are still other quasi-official mouthpieces for the government that could be covered. What has happened in the movie industry is another example to be covered. This is a question of using the best search terms and knowing where to look. Is "Bolivarian" the best term to use in the article name? Well, is it right to name the article "Venezuelan propaganda", when this phenom is occurring only since the "Bolivarian Revolution"? Are there examples of Venezuelan propaganda pre-Chavez? Or is it better to call the article "Venezuelan propaganda since 1998"? Propaganda in Venezuela would not be an adequate title, as the campaign is international. Venezuelan propaganda&#160;? Whatever the title is, the phenom occurring since the "Bolivarian revolution" is real and distinct. 	1

IMHO the more important question is how successful these investments are. Newfund started in 2008 and is a long-term investor, so this can not (yet) be measured by exit prices. Therefore the core criterion for notability is to look at the invested companies' achievements. It would be genuinely appreciated if you could indicate which alternative notability criteria you would consider for an organization like this one. 	1

Re Guy - Sources 1, 2, 4 and 5 are very much about the subject, re-telling his history in government service. Source 3 is his company's official website. The edit-warring about the Afd tag is probably due to the article creator's inexperience, and is irrelevant to determine the notability of the subject. The notability of the subject of the article should be determined by the merits of the subject not the merits of the article's author, or the shape of the article. In this case, to determine notability, we have to consider WP:POLITICIAN, and failing that WP:GNG. Question 1: Is "Accountant General of Lagos State" a statewide political office under WP:POLITICIAN Â§ 1.&#160;	1

Delete as an indiscriminate collection of information, and because the topic fails verification, and because the topic fails the general notability guideline for lack of citation to reliable sources about the topic. This article appears to be about a Maratha clan, I say appears because it lacks a lead section. It has been around for two years since 9 August 2012?, so has had plenty of time for attention. The article currently has no citations concerning clan status. Sitush removed unreliable sources in 2012. See User talk:Starrahul#Maratha clans I was not able to find reliable sources to establish clan status. Even the not-reliable "crowd-sourced" surname page entitled Nalawade Genealogy, Nalawade Family History at Geni.com is empty. I found two Wikipedia articles that linked to this article, List of Maratha dynasties and states in which it is listed under "Rulers" for Pune, Satara and Sangli without citation, and List of Marathi films where it was a false drop for the actor Arun Nalawade, which false drop I have corrected.

Please let me know if I am wrong, but there is a very similar article in Wikipedia about this topic	1
see Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2014 February 18#Agender. As seen in that discussion, there was the argument that agender is essentially the same thing as neutroisâ€Ž, and the argument that they are not the same thing. Whether they are or are not the same thing, we do not need two separate articles on these matters. Per WP:Content fork, we should not have articles about the same thing and should strive to keep topics that are pretty much the same thing (if not exactly the same thing) in one article, instead of causing our readers to go to more than one Wikipedia article for that material. When I explained to Ajfweb, in the Agender edit history, why the Agender article keeps getting deleted or redirected, and asked whether I should take this matter to WP:AfD, Ajfweb stated, "Agender is only as unnotable as neutrois. Take this to AfD if you like. The redirect is tagged as possible for expansion." Well, I don't support the Neutrois article existing either, as I essentially told an IP at the Agender talk page when commenting on Draft:Agender (the draft that the aforementioned IP created). I've been clear, as seen at Talk:Genderqueer/Archive 1#Merge proposal, that non-WP:Notable genderqueer topics, or ones that are WP:Notable but cannot be expanded much beyond a WP:Stub, should be covered at the Genderqueer article, which is the umbrella term article for all of these aspects. 	1

Delete No claim to notability is made. The only claim made is that he is devoted to teaching the principles of A Course in Miracles, but that in itself doesn't qualify as notability, because ACIM has sold around two million copies and many people have written books on it and are dedicated to teaching its principals. Does every ACIM teacher/author deserve a wiki? In my opinion, the only two ACIM figures who truly deserve Wikis are Helen Schucman (the author of "A Course in Miracles"), and Marianne Williamson who authored a book about ACIM (A Return to Love) which was an "Oprah pick" and has sold over 2 million copies	1

let's hope this one is more conclusive. I have no particular comments to add from what I said there, except that neither of the two "sources" added in the interim demonstrate notability, either. One of them is a blog post, and isn't citable for anything. Another deals with the family of the subject's wife in the years 1749-1769, which has no bearing on the subject's notability, given that a) he came from another family and b) he married in 1924, over a century and a half after the period discussed in the book being cited. - 	0

Delete. Pointless stub which talks about something that, in cricket terms, is a non-subject. Cricket is administered and played separately by England and Wales combined, by Ireland itself (Northern and the Republic combined) and by Scotland itself. In no way is it ever considered "British" or "UK". It becomes even sillier when the Irish position is considered because "Cricket in Ireland" includes the Republic and that is not part of the UK. The article cannot be expanded because there is nothing else to say	1

 Do you have any specific violations of WP policies that were not addressed in the previous nomination for deletion? Indeed, can you address any of the points made in the previous nomination? 271828182 (talk) 03:26, 18 August 2013 (UTC)  The previous nomination addressed this tournament as non-notable and unworthy of inclusion. Although this tournament has been given multiple mentions in books and news articles as stated in Nomination 1, even these are not enough to support the existence of a separate article for this particular tournament, and yet, some of these news articles even require subscriptions to be displayed in their entirety. I feel that coverage of the Ultimate Tournament of Champions should be left to List of Jeopardy	0

Try WP:OR and WP:SYNTH. The article probably has its start from this[16] which was one of the article's original EL. One person's opinion could well be the basis for this. As for the curse , it is a hodgepodge of events and people. Even though there is supposedly a curse on San Diego, this thing makes note of plenty of San Diego natives who are successfully. Like Maureen Connolly who won 9 Grand Slam Tennis events but the curse led to her horseback accident that ended her career. Sure.... 	1

  Delete Withdrawn by nominator I feel the article should be deleted for the following reasons:    The article fails to meet the "Significant coverage" portion, as defined in the General Notability Guidelines. The policy states that, the coverage should be significant so that, "no original research is needed to extract the content." While there are a few articles about Mr. Sledd's (now defunct) "Ask a Gay Man" series from his hometown and other sources or the fact that his account was relatively popular in the early days of YouTube, they are insufficient for a standalone article about him. This can be clearly contrasted with Michael Buckley, a YouTuber who is notable and has significant coversage. The coverage of Mr. Sledd is not significant and thus, there should not be a standalone article about him. Because of this lack of sources, the article consists almost entirely of original research relying on primary sources because of a lack of secondary sources about Mr. Sledd. A quick survey of these will reveal that Mr. Sledd was mentioned in a few secondary sources surveying early YouTube posters and where they are today, but he does not rise to a level of notability for a standalone article.      The article fails to meet the "Sources" portion of the General Notability Guidelines. Because of the dearth of secondary sources about Mr. Sledd's life, the article's writers have relied on primary sources (his videos on YouTube). Perhaps an article about the "Ask a Gay Man" series he had would be more appropriate than a stand-alone article on Mr. Sledd.      The article fails the "Independent of the subject" portion of the General Notability Guidelines, because the sources necessary for a stand-alone article on the subject were produced by the subject himself (i.e. primary sources).      "No subject is automatically or inherently notable merely because it exists: The evidence must show the topic has gained significant independent coverage or recognition, and that this was not a mere short-term interest, nor a result of promotional activity or indiscriminate publicity, nor is the topic unsuitable for any other reason," from the Wikipedia is not a Newspaper page. Mr. Sledd has not produced ongoing videos in his series and is inactive. It seems that he simply took advantage of the flashpan that was the budding days of YouTube. A quick check shows his latest video on his account has 15,000 views (11 months old). Does this really rise to the level of Internet Celebrity? Again, while his Ask a Gay Man series may be notable, I doubt that he, as an individual, is. While Wikipedia makes clear that "notability is not temporary" and that a notable topic may fade into obscurity, I believe a re-evaluation of the notability of this article is in order. A voter in a previous article stated that deletion would probably be pointless because Mr. Sledd was a growing trend and would continue to grow. The opposite has in fact happened and Mr. Sledd has chosen to remain a low-profile individual. This is why people should avoid speculating on the future during deletion discussions.      Many argued in previous deletion discussions that Mr. Sledd should be included as notable by virtue of his popularity on YouTube. According to VidStatsX he is the 7317th most subscribed and the 9237th most viewed. If one is to espouse that argument, should the top 10,000 of YouTube be included in Wikipedia? Disregarding this, if we look to external sources for notability, we see that they are few and far between. There were a few blogs in 2009 of former viewers wondering where he went or documenting early YouTube stars... but does this really warrant inclusion in Wikipedia??          Withdrawn by nominator The article has been completely re-written. I now believe that there are sufficient sources to warrant inclusion in Wikipedia. I was not aware many of the original sources had been removed. Kudos to whoever re-wrote the article	1

 Delete Prior to 2014 the NAB Cup was a stand-alone pre-season competition which concluded with a Grand Final, with a trophy and prize money awarded. In 2014, the NAB Challenge was changed to a set of practice matches with no winner and no prizes. This gives it no stand-alone notability as a competition, no continuity with previous pre-season competitions, no lasting historical significance, and is therefore an WP:AVOIDSPLIT violation. I go one step further to say that the primary content (the match results) is inconsequential judged on either a stand-alone basis or in the context of the 2014 AFL season, and therefore in my view it should be deleted as a whole from both 2014 NAB Challenge and the parent article 2014 AFL season, and that the most suitable location for pre-season results is the individual club season pages (e.g. 2014 Carlton Football Club season). However, I would say that a valid compromise would be to merge the results into 2014 AFL season, and format the match results in a collapsible table that defaults to the hidden condition	1
