3x23	one of my best, don't you think	0
3x23	howard, do you want to doublecheck the equatorial mount	on the laser we need it locked onto the sea of tranquility	0
3x23	you got it	0
3x23	oh, raj, no billions of dollars have gone into inventing the internet and filling it with pictures of naked women, so we don't have to peep through windows	0

3x23	not my world	0
3x23	hey, you know who'd really dig seeing this experiment penny	0
3x23	i wasn't aware that lunar ranging was her thing	although, i suppose the retroreflector left on the moon by neil armstrong does qualify as a shiny object	0
3x23	why don't you ask her to come up	1	3	ni
3x23	i don't know, it's still a little weird	since, you know	0
3x23	she dumped you	0
3x23	she didn't dump me we were just in different places in the relationship	0
3x23	i fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities	of a geographic location	0
3x23	oh, it's very simple leonard was living	in a little town called "please don't leave me"	while penny had just moved to the island of "buhbye"	0

3x23	hey	0
3x23	hello whoa is that the laser it's bitchin'	0
3x23	yes in , when albert einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper "zur quantentheorie der strahlung," his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin'	0
3x23	well, mission accomplished	0
3x23	let me explain what we're doing here	um, in , the astronauts on apollo positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon, and we're going to shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier	0
3x23	oh that's very cool	0
3x23	one question how can you be sure it won't blow up	0
3x23	the laser	0
3x23	the moon	0
3x23	see, now this is a man for penny	0
3x23	that's a great question, zack	0

3x23	don't worry about the moon	1	1	ni
3x23	wewe set our laser to stun	0
3x23	smart	0
3x23	now, we'll be able to see the beam when it leaves, but it won't be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye	0
3x23	naked	0
3x23	right uh funny uh, that device, there, will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer	0

3x23	that's the moon we hit the moon	0
3x23	that's your big experiment all that for a line on the screen leonard	0
3x23	yeah, but, uh, think about what this represents	1	1	nf
3x23	the fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man made objects on the moon, put there by a member of a species that only  years before had just invented the airplane	0
3x23	what species is that	0
3x23	i was wrong penny can do better	0
