3x18	so, Sheldon how you doing	0
3x18	that's how you start a psychotherapy session "how am i doing" i was promised a riverboat journey into the jungles of my subconscious instead, i get the same question i hear from the lady who slices my bologna at ralph's	0
3x18	i'm sorry, i'll start again	0
3x18	would it be helpful to you if i told you about my dreams	0
3x18	um, i don't know, maybe	0

3x18	why don't i just start	1	1	ni
3x18	sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if, on a subconscious level, they don't feel they deserve them do you think maybe that's what's happening here	0
3x18	really, leonard you're just going to try to recycle adler's doctrine of the inferiority complex i could probably get that from the woman at ralph's and she'd let me taste some pieces of cheese for free	0
3x18	but it could be part of your problem let me give you an example when i was eight, i won a ribbon at the science fair for my project, "do lima beans grow better to classical music" my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of my brother's earlier "do lima beans grow worse to rock 'n' roll"i felt so guilty, i gave the ribbon back	0
3x18	and how did that make you feel	0
3x18	terrible	0
3x18	i worked really hard on that project i stayed up all night singing the clown's aria from Pagliacci to a lima bean sprout	0
3x18	go on	1	1	nf
3x18	it wasn't my fault i had never seen my brother's project and my mother could've	told me before instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone	0
