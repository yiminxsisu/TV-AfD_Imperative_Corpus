3x19	hey, leonard, where do you come down on giant ants	0
3x19	sheldon says impossible howard and i say not only possible, but as a mode of transportation, way cooler than a batmobile	0
3x19	you are ignoring the squarecube law the giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton and for the record, the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is jet pack, hoverboard, transporter, batmobile, and then giant ant	0
3x19	seriously	0
3x19	you have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants	0
3x19	what's with him	0
3x19	perhaps he's at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle	0
3x19	are you saying he's manstrating	0
3x19	not literally but as far back as the th century, scientists observed a day fluctuation in men's hormone levels	0

3x19	maybe that's what they want to talk about	0
3x19	leonard, where do you stand on giant rabbits and scrotal position	0

3x19	what do you want from me	0
3x19	i just don't give a rat's ass	0

3x19	maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet	1	1	nf
3x19	okay, how about this for a topic why is leonard being a giant douche	0
3x19	assuming giant douches are possible	0
3x19	of course they are	0

3x19	maybe he's having a lover's spat with penny	0
3x19	no, there was no spat	0
3x19	oh, but something happened	0
3x19	i don't want to talk about it but i sense you're going to and i don't want to hear about it	0
