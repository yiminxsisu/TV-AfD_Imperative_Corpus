2x15	no, i didn't realize	0
2x15	it had been so long	0

2x15	he's referring to an activity	0
2x15	he has done before	0
2x15	it's unpleasant and needs to be repeated	0
2x15	this suggests some sort of invasive medical test,	0

2x15	i think it implies that the elevator doesn't work	0
2x15	again, i can read the sign but the sign and the tape are covered with a layer of dust,	0
2x15	which indicates that the elevator has been nonfunctional for a significant amount of time	0
