you know who's got to	
be the bravest person	
in the marvel universe	
whoever has to give	
shehulk a bikini wax	
you want to talk brave,	
how about captain america's	
undocumented mexican gardener	
he's not braver than	
whoever uses the	
bathroom after the thing	
as usual, you're all wrong	
the bravest person	
in the marvel universe	
is the doctor who gives	
wolverine his prostate exam	
how about the guy who gets	
a prostate exam from wolverine	
now you just being silly	
wolverine's never displayed	
the slightest interest in helping others	
prevent prostate cancer	
hello	
yes, the elevator's out of order£¬	
you'll have to use the stairs	
of course you can	
pizza dates back to the th century,	
while the first elevator	
was not installed until	
that means that for over  years,	
people carried pizzas up stairs	
be part of that proud tradition	
i'll go get penny while	
that guy spits on our food	
do you think they gave	
wolverine an adamantium prostate	
that's a stupid question	
we're having a conversation about	
probing the heinies of superheroes	
there are no stupid questions	
yes	
oh, um, is penny here	
you're leonard, right	
yeah	
damn, it's good to finally meet you, son	
okay, i think a bit of context here might help	
oh, hey, leonard i see you met my dad	
oh, good	
context	
come on in, buddy	
take a load off	
oh, gee, dad, leonard can't stay	
he just dropped by to say hello	
thanks for stopping by, sweetie	
i'll see you later	
bye	
that was odd	
are you sure you have enough comics	
you're going to be monitoring	
the telescope for  hours,	
and by my estimate, you've only selected	
seven hours of reading material	
that's even factoring in	
your difficulty in parsing	
american comic book idioms	
like "bamf" and "snikt"	
is that racist	
it feels racist	
don't be oversensitive	
he's calling you	
illiterate, not your race	
oh, okay good	
i don't need more comics	
howard's gonna stop by, we're gonna play	
intergalactic battleship	
and indian monopoly	
i don't care for novelty	
editions of monopoly	
i prefer the classics	
regular and klingon	
actually, indian monopoly's	
just like regular, except	
the money's in rupees,	
instead of hotels you build call centers,	
and when you pick a chance	
card, you might die of dysentery	
just fyi,	
that was racist	
you'll never guess what just happened	
you went out in the hallway,	
stumbled into an interdimensional portal	
which brought you ,	
years into the future,	
where you took advantage	
of the advanced technology	
to build a time machine,	
and now you're back	
to bring us all with	
you to the year	
where we are transported	
to work at the thinkatorium	
by telepathically	
controlled flying dolphins	
no	
aw	
penny kissed me	
well, who would ever guess that	
what what kind of a kiss	
a big kiss on the mouth	
is it possible that she	
was going for your cheek	
and you moved and she	
accidentally got lip	
that happens with me	
and my mom all the time	
she introduced me to her father,	
kissed me and then shut	
the door in my face	
maybe she was trying	
to send you a message	
you think	
yeah "this man is not my father	
i'm being held hostage	
so i'm going to do	
something insane in the hopes	
that you'll call "	
penny kissing me is not insane	
she used to kiss me all the time	
einstein defined insanity	
as "doing the same thing	
over and over again and	
expecting different results "	
by that standard,	
penny is cuckoo for cocoa puffs	
i'm just saying,	
it felt like it may	
have meant something	
ah, this takes me back	
leonard obsessing about penny	
i mean, don't get me wrong,	
i love your new stuff,	
but once in a while it's	
nice to hear the hits	
ooh, ooh	
do "our babies will be smart and beautiful "	
that one always makes me laugh	
why do i bother talking to you people	
if it'll make you feel	
better, we rarely listen	
hey, can i talk to you out here for a sec	
yeah, sure	
i'm starting to think we're	
never going to see that pizza	
so you're probably wondering	
what that was all about	
what, uh, the kissing and everything	
nah, women do that to me all the time	
yeah, okay the thing is, i kind of	
told my father we got	
back together again	
what why	
well, you're the first guy	
he's ever really approved of, you know	
you're a scientist who went to college	
and you don't have a neck tattoo	
or outstanding warrants or or a baby	
what kind of guys did	
you used to go out with	
just guys	
anyway, when i told him we	
split up, he was heartbroken,	
and he kept bugging me "how's leonard	
why can't you get back	
together with leonard	
i bet leonard never tipped	
a cow over on himself "	
so to get him off my back,	
i told him we worked things out	
really	
how how'd we manage that	
what	
i mean, did you apologize	
did you have to woo me	
get over yourself	
i whistled, you came running	
yeah, no, i don't think so	
okay, why are you arguing about this	
i'm just saying,	
if we fake got back together,	
that's totally not how it fake happened	
oh	
okay, whatever	
will you please just play along until my dad leaves	
hold on, you actually want me	
to deceive your father with some sort of	
sham playacting and kissing	
cause i'm good with that	
penny, you out here	
come on, honey, not in front of my dad	
relax, i've seen you do a lot worse with a lot stupider	
see	
he doesn't mind	
so, leonard, i'm taking your gal out for a steak dinner,	
you want to join us	
oh, dad, that's nice,	
but leonard has to work	
right, leonard	
uh, i do, i have to work	
but i'm gonna blow that	
off to spend the evening	
with my sweetie and her	
father, 'cause, you know,	
just the kind of boyfriend i am	
oh	
come here, you	
c	
miss	
how could that be a miss	
c was a hit,	
c was a hit	
part of your starship has to be on c	
not if it has a hole in the middle	
what kind of spaceship	
has a hole in the middle	
a romulan battle bagel	
knockknock	
oh, great, you made it	
come on in	
i invited her	
so where's the telescope	
it's in hawaii, but raj	
controls it from here	
he's hoping to see epsilon	
eridani dim, which would be	
evidence of a planet orbiting it	
so we just sit and stare at the screen,	
waiting for something to happen	
i did it with you when	
we rented "the notebook"	
yes, gena rowlands is a treasure	
you'd better open up that bottle of wine or i'm gonna end up with swimmer's ear	
excuse me	
i can't be drinking, i'm about to make	
an important scientific discovery here	
what galileo did his best	
work while drinking wine	
how do you know that	
well, he was italian	
it's a reasonable assumption	
dude, can you even open your mouth without spewing a cultural stereotype	
oh, i i'm sorry,	
galileo drank diet sprite	
look, you're my best friend, she's my girlfriend,	
you should bond	
you know, like you and my mom did	
your mom creeps the hell out of me	
yes, but she's stopped calling	
you slumdog millionaire	
i do appreciate that	
here we go	
i'd like to propose a toast	
to science and friendship	
hold on wait	
no, it's okay,	
go ahead	
what	
oh, i was working with	
penicillinresistant	
gonorrhea in the lab today	
and i was just trying to	
remember if i washed my hands	
thanks for the steak, wyatt	
my pleasure	
it's nice to have dinner	
with a boyfriend of penny's	
that knows how to use a napkin	
so not funny, dad	
let me tell you about this one	
genius she was going out with,	
this this fella donnie	
oh, will you please let it go	
donnie was gonna make	
millions turning farm waste	
into biofuel and selling	
it to the government	
a lot of people are doing that	
oh, see	
yeah, but all donnie did was	
mix pig poop with a little water	
and pump it into his mom's camry	
yeah, that's great	
it's a funny story	
moving on	
and donnie was a rocket	
scientist compared to that boy	
who wanted to get beer	
pong into the olympics	
what was his name, sweetheart	
curtis, and i'm pretty	
sure he was joking	
i don't know	
that petition looked real to me	
yeah, okay, i think this ends he ex-boyfriend portion of our evening	
well, i'm just glad you	
finally found yourself a keeper	
thanks, wyatt	
i'm a keeper	
leonard, you want to come in for a nightcap	
oh, gee, dad, he'd love to,	
but leonard has to work in the morning	
maybe i could go in a little late	
no, no, no, you can't	
your career is far too important	
behind every great	
man is a nagging woman	
who won't let him have any	
fun, am i right, leonard	
don't i know it	
well, good night, son	
good night, wyatt	
oh, good night, honey	
good night	
i love you	
love you, too	
oh, friggetyfrak	
not this again	
three, four, five pass	
go, get , rupees	
six, seven	
whoops can't go any further	
there's a sacred cow in my way	
bernadette, please tell your boyfriend to cool it with the cow jokes	
it won't help	
once he finds a joke he	
likes, he sticks with it	
yeah	
like his haircut material	
oh, right did you get your hair cut	
"no i got them all cut "	
which is still so funny	
and when you go to a chinese restaurant,	
he always gets the same	
fortune in his fortune cookie	
right "help, i'm a prisoner	
in a chinese fortune cookie factory "	
okay, i think that's enough about me	
he's right	
let's make fun of his mother	
"howard, come rub my feet	
my corns are killing me"	
"howard, help me out of the tub	
i'm stuck again"	
coming	
hey, lovebug	
shut up	
you know what i've been	
doing for the last hour	
mm, dreamily doodling	
"mrs leonard hofstadter"	
in a notebook	
listening to my father go on and on	
about what a great guy you are	
you got to admit, i	
am i'm delightful	
why are you making this so difficult	
it's not difficult for me	
i'm having fun	
leonard	
what do you want me to	
do you started this	
do you want to go over and	
tell him we're broken up	
no	
well, then, what do you want	
i don't know	
don't you think that's	
something you should	
have figured out before	
you stomped over here	
maybe	
leonard, penny, excellent	
i'd like to say i'm very happy	
that you're back together,	
and if i can figure out a way to do so	
and sound sincere, i will	
in the meantime,	
i'd like to go over	
some proposed changes	
to the roommate agreement	
specifically to address	
penny's annoying personal habits	
oh, my god	
what personal habits	
i have a list	
fyi, overuse of the phrase	
"oh, my god" is number	
okay, sheldon, you don't have to do this	
because leonard and i	
are not  babababa	
are you sure you want	
to include him in this	
include me in what	
is there a plot afoot	
i'll have no truck with plots	
no, you're right	
no, there's there's no	
plots, no trucks, no feet	
so what other annoying	
habits shall we discuss	
uh, we don't discuss anything	
leonard is the signatory	
to the roommate agreement	
as such, he bears responsibility	
for all your infractions	
and must pay all fines	
fines	
yes	
if penny's going to be	
spending nights here again,	
you'll need to set up an escrow account	
sign here	
hello, hawaii	
this is dr koothrappali in pasadena	
i'd like you to reposition the telescope, please	
scarlett johansson's house	
i'm kidding, hawaii	
mahalo	
whoo	
it might have been a mistake	
to open that second bottle of wine	
well, live and learn	
so, raj, do you think this planet you're looking for	
could have an atmosphere	
that supports life	
maybe	
if it did, i'd be famous	
i'd be on the cover of magazines	
and then, instead of living alone	
in my tiny apartment,	
i'd have a big mansion	
that sounds great	
it is	
if you like wandering	
around a big, empty house	
with no one to love you	
we'd come visit you	
no, you wouldn't	
you'd be intimidated	
by my wealth and fame	
my only friends would be	
my genetically engineered monkey butler	
and the little people i hired	
to be my living chess set	
he's taking a turn to	
the dark side, isn't he	
hold on he could come back	
oh, what's the point of everything	
nope he's gone	
you know it's been more than a year	
since i've even kissed a girl	
what about that hookup at	
comiccon you told me about	
oh, grow up	
i was lying	
i lie all the time	
nobody wants to kiss me	
oh, you poor, poor thing	
raj, you have to know	
you're a wonderful man	
there are a lot of girls out	
there who'll want to kiss you	
where	
you just have to look	
no	
well, this was fun	
oh i think i got a nibble	
oh, be careful	
give him some line	
okay, now reel him in	
oh, look at that baby	
they're really biting, huh	
yeah they do that	
when you set it on easy	
oh, that's me	
hello	
oh, hi, sweetie	
yeah, i got up early and	
didn't want to wake you,	
so i went out for coffee and ran into leonard on the way back	
guess what we're fishing	
yeah right here on his couch	
hey, baby i love you	
that's leonard	
says he loves you	
what	
i see	
the whole thing's bull squirt, huh	
well, that's very disappointing	
bye	
oh, hey	
there's been something i've	
been meaning to tell you	
i can't believe you	
would lie to me like that	
just for the record, i did not want to be a part of this	
i'll get to you in a minute	
no hurry	
that my own daughter thinks	
i don't love her enough	
to support her no matter	
what choices she makes	
well, that hurts me deeply	
i'm sorry, daddy	
let me finish	
oh	
i thought we were past the days	
when you would try to	
pull the wool over my eyes	
telling me the baggie in your	
underwear drawer is potpourri	
and the pee stick in your bathroom	
is to check for diabetes	
you know, i'm sorry	
you're a grown woman,	
and i respect your right	
to make your own	
decisions, but all i ask	
is you respect me enough	
to be honest about them	
you're right look, from now	
on, i will tell you the truth	
thank you now,	
why don't you go and put some clothes on and we'll grab a bite to eat before i head for the airport	
now you	
daddy, he had nothing to do	
keep walking	
okay	
please, please, please don't give up on her	
what	
i can't go back to	
the skateboard idiots,	
the white rappers and all those	
sweaty dumbasses with	
their backwards hats	
gee, i don't know if	
it's in the cards, sir	
then, stack the deck	
cheat	
lie	
i don't care	
i want grandkids before i die,	
and i want them to grow up	
in a house without wheels	
i'll give it a shot	
thank you	
now i'm going to do something	
here to help you along	
excuse me	
just don't panic	
now, get your sorry,	
lying ass out of my face	
and make sure i never see it again	
oh, the reverse psychology thing	
i see that's very clever	
don't yap	
just get out	
i'll friend you on facebook	
oh, there you are	
just so you know, i was up all night,	
but i have finally completed	
the pennyspecific section	
of the new roommate agreement	
yeah, well, not necessary	
we broke up again	
do you even think about	
other people, leonard	
do you	
hey	
oh, how'd it go last night	
oh, you know	
same old, same old	
looked through a	
telescope, saw some stars	
big whoop	
really	
you waited months for	
time with that telescope	
what happened	
why you writing a book	
i'm going to propose a hypothesis	
last night, raj	
accidentally made contact	
with an alien civilization	
and has been ordered by	
the united states government	
to keep it a secret	
nothing happened	
can we please just change the subject	
that sounds rehearsed	
we are not alone	
hey	
hey	
hello	
hey	
hey	
you get to play with raj's	
big telescope last night	
whoa	
where did that come from	
he never touched my telescope	
way to go shutting up	
i did shut up	
now you shut up	
fine	
thank you
