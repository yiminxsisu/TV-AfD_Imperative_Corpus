water demon	
ice dragon	
lesser warlord	
of ka'a	
not so fast	
infinite sheldon	
infinite sheldon	
yes, infinite sheldon	
defeats all other cards	
and does not violate the	
rule against homemade cards	
because i made	
it at work	
do you understand why people	
don't want to play with you	
no	
although it's a question i've	
been pondering since preschool	
hey	
hey	
hey	
hey, your copy of science	
magazine was in my mailbox	
oh, thanks	
mmhmm	
check it out	
all about planets this month	
that's an atom	
agree to disagree	
that's what i love	
about science	
there's no	
one right answer	
so	
you and zack again, huh	
yeah, yeah, me	
and zack again	
were we here earlier	
okay, we should,	
we should go	
ah, not yet	
i want to talk science	
with the science dudes	
oh, and the science dudes want	
to talk science with you	
what do you want	
to talk about	
rocks, dinosaurs, our	
friend the beaver	
you know, i saw this great thing	
on the discovery channel	
turns out	
that if you kill a starfish,	
it'll just come back to life	
was the starfish	
wearing boxer shorts	
because you might have	
been watching nickelodeon	
no, i'm almost sure that	
it was the discovery channel	
it was a great show	
they also said dolphins	
might be smarter than people	
they might be smarter	
than some people	
maybe we can do an	
experiment to find out	
that's easy enough	
we'd need a large tank of	
water, a hoop to jump through,	
and a bucket of whatever	
bitesized treats	
you find tasty	
i don't get it	
a dolphin might	
oh, i see	
you guys are inferring	
that i'm stupid	
that's not correct	
we were implying it	
you then inferred it	
let's go	
you know, for a group of guys	
who claim they spent most	
of their lives being bullied,	
you can be real jerks	
shame on all of you	
what the hell did i do	
you laughed	
do you think	
penny's right	
were we bullying zack	
no,	
i know bullying	
he left here unswirlied and his	
ass crack was underpantsfree	
and nobody drew	
a penis on his forehead	
that happened to you	
first day of cricket camp	
they drew it	
so the testicles were my eyes	
i don't know, i think	
we might owe the guy an apology	
so go apologize	
why me	
you started it,	
we just piled on	
what would i even say	
zack, i'm sorry you're stupid	
have a milk dud	
a milk dud	
yeah,	
milk duds,	
with their selfdeprecating name	
and remarkably mild flavor,	
are the most apologetic	
of the boxed candies	
i got a better idea	
we're all responsible	
i say we all go	
come on, who's with me	
free comic books	
to anyone who comes with me	
i might get punched	
you really want to miss that	
junior mints are	
pretty apologetic	
you're embarrassing	
yourself	
penny	
what	
yeah,	
we came to talk to zack	
hey, zack	
what do you want	
listen,	
the stuff	
we were saying before	
we were just kidding around	
no, you weren't	
you were making fun	
of me	
come on, that's what we do	
we give each other a hard time	
hey, sheldon,	
you look	
like a praying mantis	
that's very hurtful	
see	
i don't know,	
it still wasn't very nice	
milk dud	
oh, i love milk duds	
okay, we're cool	
junior mints	
you guys want to come in and have a beer	
uh, we're on our way	
to the comic book store	
leonard's buying	
really	
i haven't been	
to a comic book store	
in literally	
a million years	
literally	
literally a	
million years	
don't you want to go with 'em	
no	
okay, see you later	
wait,	
wwwwait, you're ditching me	
to go look at comic books	
are you mad at me	
i'm not happy	
milk dud	
wow, this place	
is awesome	
where do they keep	
the archies	
in the bedrooms of tenyear	
old girls, where they belong	
oh, no, you're thinking	
oldschool archie	
it's much more	
sophisticated now	
like, there's	
two universes,	
and archie's married	
to betty in one	
and veronica	
in the other	
midge is even breaking	
up with moose	
no	
about time, right	
hey	
hey	
you guys finally chip in	
for a bodyguard	
uh, no oh,	
this is zack	
he's a friend	
of ours	
zack, this is stuart	
he owns	
the store	
wow, lucky you	
yeah, i work	
hours a week	
and average	
$ an hour	
sweet	
is that sarcasm	
no, it's an indictment of the	
american education system	
the archies are over here	
yippee	
so are you guys coming to my new year's eve costume party	
of course	
we're coming as the	
justice league of america	
switching it up from last year	
when we came as	
the justice league of america	
to that point,	
it occurs to me that we	
might have an opportunity	
to finally snare	
best group costume	
if we shore up	
our weak link,	
which is clearly	
leonard as superman	
hey, i got	
new boots this year	
guaranteed to add	
three inches	
that's sad	
is there anyone we know	
who would make a more manly	
and convincing son of krypton	
than leonard	
in highheeled boots	
howard's mother	
in highheeled boots	
i was thinking specifically	
of the gentleman over there	
moving his lips	
as he enjoys	
the latest exploits	
of betty and veronica	
zack	
he is the only person we know	
with actual muscles	
you can't replace	
me with zack	
why not	
penny did it	
yeah, she seems happier	
why wouldn't we be	
score	
i got an archie,	
betty and veronica,	
and a jughead	
all set	
for my weekend number twos	
congratulations	
zack, how would you	
like to be superman	
i don't know, sounds like	
a lot of responsibility	
fine, if zack's going	
to be superman,	
i want to be	
green lantern	
but i'm green lantern	
you can be aquaman	
i don't want to be aquaman	
he sucks	
he sucks	
underwater	
he sucks	
fish pee	
excuse me,	
i believe aquaman uses	
his telepathic powers	
to request the fish do	
their business elsewhere	
hey, babe	
i'm still mad at you	
well, you won't be	
when you hear the great news	
what great news	
we're going to	
a costume party	
at the comic book store	
on new year's eve,	
and you get to be wonder woman	
complete with bulletproof	
bracelets and lasso of truth	
invisible plane sold separately	
wait, why me	
whwhy can't your girlfriend	
be wonder woman	
she and her lab team	
are under quarantine	
seems at the christmas party	
they were doing jello shots	
out of petri dishes that used	
to contain yellow fever	
okay, what about	
your friend amy	
amy farrah fowler doesn't believe in wearing costumes	
she isn't the free spirit i am	
okay, well, forget it	
i'm not spending	
my new year's eve	
at a comic book store	
wearing a wonder woman costume	
he says he'll wear it	
if you'll be aquaman	
what are you doing	
we're going	
to be late	
i'm pacing nervously	
you're jogging	
this is how the	
flash paces	
just chill out, sheldon	
i'm not sheldon	
i'm the flash	
and now i'm going	
to the grand canyon	
to scream in frustration	
i'm back	
i'm batman	
oh, i hardly think so	
the real caped crusader calls	
his crimefighting cohorts	
when he's running late	
i had to walk	
i couldn't get raj	
on the back of my scooter	
i've said this before,	
and i'll say it again	
aquaman sucks	
look up in the sky	
it's a bird it's a plane	
i forget the rest	
all right let's get this thing over with	
i'm sorry	
but in what universe	
is wonder woman blonde	
relax	
no one's going to	
be looking at her hair	
ow	
i mean,	
ow	
hold on	
the costume came with a black wig	
where is it, babe	
no i'm not wearing	
it it looks stupid	
come on we're trying	
to win a contest here	
forget it	
i'm not wearing the wig	
honey, there's no "i"	
in "justice league"	
well, actually	
don't	
he's making our case	
okay, babe uh	
kind of embarrassing me	
in front of my friends	
okay	
you know what	
i changed my mind	
i'm not going	
looks like someone	
else is going	
to have to be wonder woman	
babe, open up	
i'm not talking to you	
then who are you talking to	
babe	
penny, penny, penny, penny,	
penny, penny, penny,	
penny, penny, penny,	
penny, penny, penny, penny,	
penny, penny, penny, penny	
penny, penny	
what the hell	
is wrong with you	
i'm the flash	
i just knocked , times	
okay what do you want, sheldon	
i understand	
why you're upset	
really	
yes	
you're afraid that costume	
makes you look fat	
no	
whwhat	
does it	
don't worry	
wonder woman	
was an amazon	
and amazons tend to	
be very beefy gals	
goodbye, sheldon	
but they're not blonde,	
so put on your wig	
hello	
stupid aquaman	
if it makes you	
feel any better,	
when i was dating penny,	
she used to flip out	
on me all the time	
whoa you dated penny	
she didn't tell you	
she told me she dated	
a guy named leonard	
who would have	
thought it was you	
who else would it be	
i don't know somebody	
bigger and	
yeah, sure	
why not you	
i may have failed	
okay, i guess we just go	
without a wonder woman	
i don't want to go	
without penny	
oh, great no superman,	
no wonder woman	
all we've got is a skinny flash,	
an indian aquaman,	
a nearsighted	
green lantern,	
and a teeny, tiny	
dark knight	
obviously, we're no longer	
a justice league	
we have no choice but to switch	
to our muppet baby costumes	
ooh, i call kermit	
i'm kermit	
you're scooter	
oh, man	
scooter sucks	
he's the aquaman	
of the muppet babies	
no, we can still	
make this work	
leonard,	
you talk to penny	
what makes you think	
i can convince her	
you got her	
to have sex with you	
obviously, your superpower is brainwashing	
okay, let me see	
if i understand this	
you want me to convince my exgirlfriend	
to go to a costume party	
with her new boyfriend	
just so we can win	
a stupid prize	
yes and make her wear the black wig	
good luck	
go away, sheldon	
it's leonard	
oh	
go away, leonard	
come on, let me	just talk to you	
it's open	
hey	
i'm not going	
to that party, leonard	
okay, listen	
you don't have to wear the wig	
at this party,	
we're gonna win first prize	
just by showing up with a girl	
it's not the wig	
did i do something	
i mean, i tried to be	
friends with zack,	
like you said, which believe me,	
was difficult,	
given how you and me	
used to be	
you know, "you and	
me," and now you	
and him are	
"you and him"	
okay, look	
we're not really "me and him"	
then what are you	
i don't know	
i only started seeing zack again	
so i wouldn't be alone	
on new year's eve	
how pathetic is that	
not as pathetic	
as dressing up like this	
and going to a comic book store	
on new year's eve	
you make a cute green arrow	
green lantern	
like there's a difference	
there's a big difference	
arrow	
lantern	
whatever look,	
if zack and i had just gone	
to a regular club or a party,	
it would have been fine,	
but this, with the costumes,	
and you	
what about me	
nothing	
let's go to the party	
how do i look	
um	
i guarantee you'll be	
the prettiest girl there	
okay, the good news is,	
we have a wonder woman	
oh	
yes	
what's the bad news	
superman probably isn't	
getting laid tonight	
aw, damn	
and the award	
for best group costume	
goes to	
justice league of america	
number three	
thank you	
thank you so much	
okay okay, ten	
seconds to midnight	
ten, nine, eight	
no, wait	
i have a speech	
seven, six	
stop counting	
five, four, three	
this is my moment, dag nab it	
two, one	
happy new year	
i'm not going	
to say another word	
until you people settle down	
i'm waiting	
that was a	
great party	
we should dress like	
this all the time	
are you high	
you're being	
a bully	
check it out	
those guys are breaking	
into that car	
what should we do	
we're the justice league	
of america	
there's only one thing	
we can do	
turn around and slowly walk away	
nah	
hold up	
look, i know our winter	
thermostat setting	
is  degrees,	
but i'm a little warm,	
so i'm going	
to turn it down	
good lord,	
how you frustrate me,	
leonard hofstadter
