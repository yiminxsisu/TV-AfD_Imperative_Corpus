all right, i'm ready for my next question	
in a world where rhinoceroses are domesticated pets,	
who wins the second world war	
uganda	
defend	
kenya rises to power	
on the export of rhinoceroses a central african	
power block is formed,	
colonizing north africa and europe	
when war breaks out, no one can	afford the luxury of a rhino	
kenya withers, uganda triumphs	
correct	
my turn	
in a world where a piano is a weapon,	
not a musical instrument,	
on what does scott joplin play "the maple leaf rag"	
tuned bayonets	
defend	
isn't it obvious	
you're right my apologies	
what the hell are you guys playing	
it's a game we invented	
it's called counterfactuals	
we postulate an alternate world that differs from ours in one key aspect and then pose questions to each other	
it's fun for ages eight to	
join us	
all right	
i like a good brainteaser	
give it a whirl	
you're in luck	
this is an easy one	
in a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver,	
what food is no longer consumed	
uh a blt where the "b" stands for beaver	
i don't know	
leonard, be serious	
we're playing a game here	
i can figure this out	
let's see	
um, well, beavers eat tree bark	
the only tree bark i know that	
humans consume is cinnamon	
so, i'll say cinnamon	
incorrect	
obviously, the answer	
is cheese danish	
what	
in a world ruled by a giant beaver,	
mankind builds many dams to please the beaver overlord	
the lowlying city of copenhagen is flooded	
thousands die devastated, the danes never invent their namesake pastry	
how does one miss that	
this is ridiculous	
you're just making stuff up	
is he always like this when he loses	
oh, yes	
you should've been here for the	great jenga tantrum of	
you bumped the table	
and you know it	
perhaps it would be kinder to play a game more suited to his abilities	
we'll close our eyes and count to ten while you hide	
i'm going to my room	
very good, leonard	
but next time, don't tell us where you're hiding	
did you guys see the paper in the american physics journal on supersolids	
it's pretty interesting	
this guy's working from	a hypothesis where spoiler alert spoiler alert	
what	
don't ruin it for me, man	
i printed out a pdf to read on the potty on the potty	
what are you, five	
it's a potty what do you call it	
toilet	
that's a little vulgar for the dinner table, don't you think	
oh, and "potty" is okay	
"potty" is innocent	
"potty" is adorable	
what do you do in the potty,	
weewee	
if i don't have to boomboom	
greetings	
you all remember amy farrah fowler	
nice to see you hello	
sorry we're late	
i must take responsibility	
i had to stop for feminine hygiene supplies	
aha okay	
i believe she's experiencing her menses	
actually, i'm not	
in order to avoid surprises,	
i wear them all the time	
aha okay	
"toilet's" sounding pretty good now, huh	
hey, look, it's shamy	
shamy	
a juvenile amalgamation of our names	
sheldon, amy shamy	
oh	
i don't like that	
don't do that	
all righty what's new	
well, just recently, i learned that you refer to us as shamy,	
and i don't like that	
i got it	
but what i was going for was,	
you know, how's your life	
like everybody else's subject to entropy, decay and eventual death	
thank you for asking	
why is she not taking our order	
i should've warned you,	
one has to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense	
before one can be fed here	
amy really	
i assumed an establishment called the cheesecake factory would function more efficiently	
it's how they lure you in	
i believe it's called "	
bait and switch"	
okay, i'm just gonna walk away,	
'cause i don't want to be here	
so, this is nice	
first time we've all	
gotten together to eat	
you're right, he's a festival of humdrum chitchat	
okay, that's all i got	
howard, you're up	
um tell us about your work, amy	
i doubt you'd understand	
sheldon tells me you only have a master's degree	
raj, do you have any questions for amy	
i'm curious as to why	
we're not eating alone	
they can't function without me	
i'm the social glue that holds	
this little group together	
you're welcome	
listen, can i talk to you about your girlfriend	
she's not my girlfriend	
she's a girl and she's my friend,	
but there's no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva	
got it	
although, for the record,	
on one occasion,	
she licked her thumb to remove raspberry jelly	
from the corner of my mouth	
it's an action we both regret to this day	
uhhuh	
anyway, i'm not sure	
she's the best fit	
for our little how should	
we call it rebel alliance	
oh, i never identified with the rebel alliance	
despite their tendency to build death stars,	
i've always been more of an empire man	
yeah, not my point	
i know what your point is	
you're intimidated	
by amy's intellect	
to that i say,	
buck up	
okay, let me just	
get right to it	
amy is judgmental,	
sanctimonious and frankly	
just obnoxious	
so	
so we already have you for all that	
are you suggesting i terminate my relationship with amy	
no, no, of course not	
just have your relationship someplace else	
may i point out that	
for eight long months,	
i suffered in silence	
as your female companion filled our apartment with her	
offkey country music caterwauling,	
the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone against her calloused feet	
in our living room,	
and night after night of uninformative tv documentaries	
about the jersey shore	
suffered in silence	
yes	
and i'd thank you to do the same	
reall silence	
ah	
nothing makes beer taste better than cool clear rocky	
mountain spring water	
where are the rocky mountains, anyway	
philadelphia	
really	
i thought they were out west someplace	
think about it, raj	
where did the movie	
rocky take place	
philadelphia	
okay, now i get it	
so this is the plan	
from now on, we're just	gonna hide out in here to avoid the shamy	
i'm very comfortable here	
penny, dear, why don't you shoot another silver bullet my way	
get one yourself	
ooh, somebody's been taking bitchy pills	
god, he's an ass when he drinks	
oh, he's an ass when he doesn't	
you just don't hear it	
think we need to start entertaining the possibility that the shamy could go on for years	
well, if that's the case,	
penny will have to get satellite tv	
and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place	
i thought you were going to talk to sheldon	
i did well, what'd he say	
well, he pointed out that	
he kinda sorta had to	
put up with you	
kinda sorta had to	
i didn't agree with him	
well, you defended me, right	
i tried, but	
he made a fairly wellreasoned argument	
you're not doing that right	
what	
gimme	
no	
trust me	
no i do this for	
my mom all the time	
see	
with the grain	
wow, that is better	
and someday, when you have varicose veins,	
i'll show you how to massage them	
oh, god, never again	
i assume by "never again,	
" you mean never again will you drink	
all of penny's beer,	
then run down to the gas station	
for a couple of s,	
a box of slim jims	
and the latest issue of	bombay badonkadonks	
i was homesick	
the highlight of the evening was when you showed us your bollywood break dancing skills	
that's very offensive	
yeah, we all thought so	
leonard oh, no	
what	
it's john and yoko	
more like yoko and yoko	
greetings hey	
i brought amy here to show her some of the work i'm doing	
it's very impressive,	
for theoretical work	
do i detect a hint of condescension	
i'm sorry, was i being too subtle	
i meant compared to the realworld applications of neurobiology,	
theoretical physics is what's the word i'm looking for	
hmm, cute	
are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist	
like babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like clarkemaxwell or dirac	
i'm stating it outright	
babinski eats dirac for breakfast	
and defecates clarkemaxwell	
you take that back	
absolutely not	
my colleagues and i are mapping the neurological substrates that subserve global information processing,	
which is required for all cognitive reasoning, including scientific inquiry, making my research ipso facto	
prior in the ordo cognoscendi	
that means it's better than his research,	
and by extension, of course, yours	
i'm sorry, i'mi'm still trying to work on the defecating clark maxwell, so	
excuse me, but a grand unified theory,	
insofar as it explains everything,	
will ipso facto explain neurobiology	
yes, but if i'm successful,	
i will be able to map and reproduce your thought processes in deriving a grand unified theory,	
and therefore, subsume your conclusions under my paradigm	
that's the rankest psychologism,	
and was conclusively revealed as hogwash by gottlob frege in the s	
we appear to have reached an impasse	
i agree	
i move our relationship	terminate immediately	
seconded	
there being no objections	
all uhuh	
the motion carries	
good day, amy farrah fowler	
good day, sheldon cooper	
women, huh	
can't live with them,	
can't successfully refute their hypotheses	
amen to that	
hey, sheldon	
hello	
i hear you broke up with amy	
a breakup would imply	
she was my girlfriend	
she was a girl who was my friend	
who is now a girl who is not my friend	
wow that's like the worst country song ever	
so, how are you doing	
regarding what	
amy	
i don't follow	
well, breakups or whatever the	
hell this is can be tough	
penny, i assure you, i'm fine	
my relationship with amy was purely intellectual,	
there were no emotional bonds, the severing of which would cause me any discomfort	
the relationship simply	outlived its utility,	
and i'm continuing on	
with my life as before	
okay good	
now, if you'll excuse me,	
i'm off to buy a pussycat	
i gotta tell you guys,	
i'm a little worried about sheldon	
we're all a little worried about sheldon	
no, i mean since the shamy hit a reef	
oh, i thought you were just making a generalization	
"you know,	
i'm worried about sheldon	
"someday setting off a lowyield nuclear device	
because the cafeteria ran out of lime jello"	
what does "hit a reef" mean	
uh, went splitsville	
pardon	
turned to boomboom	
ah	
i think sheldon really misses amy	
you should lend him your copy of bombay badonkadonks	
he got a cat to keep him company	
you're kidding	
he takes it everywhere to bed, to the bathroom	
he takes the kitty to the potty	
i thought we discussed the pword	
don't try to change me, dude	
i am what i am	
oh, gentlemen	
hey aren't you going to introduce us to your little friend	
my apologies	
raj, howard, i'd like you to meet dr	
robert oppenheimer	
hello hi	
now, if you'll excuse me,	
the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk	
okay, i get it	
we're worried about sheldon	
yeah	
hey	
oh, no	
robert oppenheimer was lonely	
so you decided to get the	
whole manhattan project	
but he's so zazzy	
okay, we need to talk	
about what	
cats, sheldon	
you're clearly upset about amy being gone,	
and you're trying to replace her with a bunch of cats	
clowder what	
a group of cats is a clowder	
or a glaring	
okay, yeah, fine	
it's the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one	
terrific my point is,	
you need to face up to what you're feeling with this breakup	
it wasn't a breakup	
a breakup would imply that	
amy was my girlfriend	
okay, i got it, i got it	
she's not your girlfriend	
now listen to me	
i know about loneliness	
i know about trying to replace	
someone with other stuff	
when i broke up with penny,	
i got back into my cello,	
i built a bunch of model rockets,	
i got those weightlifting gloves	
and that fivepound dumbbell	
you didn't break up,	
she dumped you	
she didn't dump me	
it was mutual	
i was there she dumped you	
okay, fine	
live with cats	
be like my aunt nancy	
she had dozens of them	
and do you know what happened	
after she died they ate her	
you don't have to sell me on cats, leonard	
i'm already a fan	
all right, fellas,	
who's in the mood for fancy feast	
well, that's not fancy at all	
hi, mrs cooper thanks for coming	
where is he	
he's in his bedroom	
now, when you said on the phone	
he broke up with a girl,	
you meant an actual girl,	
not something you kids	
whipped up in a lab	
no, she's real	
did they sin	
no, no, it's not like that	
it's, uh	
i don't know what it's like	
but there is something i should prepare you for	
oh, relax, leonard,	
i have raised that boy	
i've seen him at his best,	
i've seen him at his worst	
there's nothing he can	
do that'll surprise me	
hold on to that thought	
come in	
surprise	
mom, what an unexpected pleasure	
my, my, that's a powerful smell	
i'd like you to meet oppenheimer,	
frisch, panofsky,	
feynman, weisskopf	
yeah, i get it	
you got a lot of cats	
and you gave 'em cute jewish names	
what are you doing here	
leonard called	
and he said that you were pining for a young lady	
oh, that's preposterous	
i'm not pining over anyone	
oh, lambchop, we can quibble what to call it,	
but i think we can	
both agree it's creepy	
i do not agree	
cats make wonderful companions	
they don't argue or question	
my intellectual authority,	
and this little guy here,	
i think you'll find to be quite zazzy	
you should have called sooner	
shelly dinner's ready	
sheldon coming	
no cats	
aw	
what is she doing here	
i called her	
your mother thinks	
you might be losing your mind over me	
as a neurobiologist, i was curious	
well, rest assured, i am in full possession of my faculties	
cats	
oh, god bless you, dear	
sheldon, sit down let's talk	
all right, but you're not fooling me	
whenever you say we have to talk,	
it means you want me to listen	
then stop talking	
yes, ma'am	
now, the reason i called amy over was to find out what type of person she is	
and after chatting a bit,	
i have to say that while she is a perfectly unique young woman,	
you two are definitely not suited for each other	
that's a peculiar conclusion	
by any standard,	
amy is more similar to me	
than anyone i've ever met	
oh, i'm sorry, shelly,	
i can't see it	
well, whether you see it or not is irrelevant	
i can't see subatomic particles,	
but nevertheless, they're there	
excellent point	
a physics point	
touché	
well, putting aside the pig latin,	
it's a good thing that you two decided to end the relationship	
so i didn't have to end it for you	
amy, after consideration,	
i believe we may have acted rashly	
i propose we resume our relationship	
and attempt to resolve our differences	
i'll agree to that only	
if you'll stipulate that % of our difficulties were caused by you	
i'll go as high as  sixtyfive	
done	
you understand that moving forward,	
we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you	
i do i find being cast in the role of bad	
girl oddly titillating	
would you like to see my cats	
i would i love cats	
they're the epitome of indifference	
ah, then you may find	
zazzles a little cloying	
i saw what you did there	
he thinks he's such a smarty pants	
he's no different from any man	
you tell 'em not to do	
something, that's all	
they want to do	
if i hadn't told my brother stumpy	
not to clear out the wood chipper by hand,	
we'd still be calling him edward	
now, don't you move	
i'll bring over all the food	
no, no, no, i can do it	
well, isn't that sweet	
thank you, amy	
here's your cat	
and here's your $	
amy	
next	
thank you, amy	
here's your cat	
and here's your $
