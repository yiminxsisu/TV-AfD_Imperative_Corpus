all i'm saying is, if they took all the money they spent	
trying to make a decent hulk movie,	
they could probably	
just make an actual hulk that is apt and amusing	
i think i shall share that with amy farrah fowler	
she'll appreciate the witticism	
thank you	
it'll also help improve her initial impression of you	
so what's going on with you two	
well, the status is	
as it always was	
she's a girl she's a friend	
she is not my	
please forgive me for doing this	
"girlfriend"	
right, right	
so you're still just texting and emailing	
you don't feel any need to hang out with her, you know be in the same room	
leonard, you are my best friend	
i've known you for seven years,	
and i can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you	
imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical proximity to amy farrah fowler	
got it	
i sense judgment on your part	
no, no	
maybe a little	
may i suggest that your	
criticism is based on jealousy	
jealousy what do i	
have to be jealous of	
i have a functioning	
and satisfying relationship with a female	
you have none	
oh, right that	
jealousy is an ugly greeneyed monster	
not unlike the hulk	
who, by the way,	
also has a girlfriend in this iteration,	
jennifer connelly,	
whom you may recall as the girlfriend of russell crowe	
in a beautiful mind,	
a feelgood romp if there ever was one	
i'm not jealous	
leonard not jealous	
you know, it just occurred to me,	
if there are an infinite number of parallel universes,	
in one of them,	
there's probably a sheldon	
who doesn't believe parallel universes exist	
probably what's your point	
no point	
it's just one of the things	
that makes one of the mes chuckle	
what makes you chuckle, leonard	
hmm, recently	
not much	
is it because of the conflict that arises from your desperate need	
to pairbond with a woman,	
and the apparent collective decision of all womankind to deny you that opportunity	
um	
shut up	
sheldon you know,	
when my grandfather died,	
and meemaw was alone,	
my mom arranged for her	to visit a center three times a week	
where she could socialize with other lonely people	
it's very nice	
they discuss current events, play bridge, get a hot meal	
that sounds lovely	
it is if you like bridge	
do you like bridge,	
leonard	
sheldon, i'm just not dating someone right now	
i don't need to go to a senior center	
meemaw resisted at first,	
but now she loves it	
fine if i don't meet someone soon, you can put me in a home	
it's not a home	
it's a senior center	
we'd never put	
meemaw in a home	
hey, guys	
hey	
hey	
all right, i'll bow to social pressure hey	
excuse me that's my girlfriend,	
bernadette	
i assigned her	
her own ringtone	
"bernadette,"	
by the four tops	
hello, bernadette	
when i call him, his phone plays "brown eyed girl"	
which, now that i think about it, is not so good	
you realize he's just rubbing our noses in the fact	
that he has a girlfriend,	
and we don't	
you mean, you don't	
you have a girlfriend	
how could you have a girlfriend	
you can't even speak to women	
two words deaf chick	
it doesn't matter	
if i can't talk,	
because she can't hear me	
what	
that's what she said	
great you have a girlfriend,	
howard's got a girlfriend,	
sheldon's got a girl	
no, no, no, no	
who's a friend	
thank you	
what about you, stuart	
you have a girlfriend yet	
oh, yeah yeah	
i met her at comiccon,	
the one place in the world	
where saying	
"i own a comic bookstore" is an actual pickup line	
oh well, good for you	
not really she's horrible	
when she wants to have sex,	
she puts on her plussize	
wonder woman costume and shouts,	
"who wants to take a ride in my invisible plane"	
why don't you just break up with her	
no, no, i can't	
why not	
'cause then i'd be alone,	
like you	
dude, why don't you just invoke your girlfriend pact with wolowitz	
because i don't	need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriends	
i'm perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own	
oh, leonard, you remind me of the funny old story about a man	
who walks into a women's correctional institution with a stack of paperwork	
that will allow the female convicts to go free	
you're saying i	couldn't get laid in a women's prison with a handful of pardons	
are you going to let me	
tell the story or not	
leonard	
are you sleeping	
no	
are you ill	
no	
are you still depressed	
because you're alone,	
and no one loves you	
i don't know maybe	
i want you to know	
that i'm genuinely concerned about your wellbeing	
thank you	
you're welcome	
but it's still no reason to have your feet in my spot	
amy	
may i offer an observation	
what the hell	
how long has she been here	
since we got home from the comic bookstore	
that was two hours ago	
as per your suggestion,	
we're hanging out	
quite frankly, i don't see	
what all the hoopla's about	
go on, amy	
from a neurobiological	
standpoint, leonard,	
you may be alone	
because your psychological state is causing an actual pheromonebased stink of desperation	
did you know that, leonard	
no	
i did	
i understand	
that some people find mates	
in social gathering places	
such as bars or taverns	
have you tried a bar or tavern	
no, i'm not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar	
wise decision you see, amy,	
success at a bar is based	
on classic male attributes	
such as height, strength,	
attractiveness,	
the ability to hold one's liquor	
and throw darts separately or together	
leonard has none of these	
attributes, right, leonard	
right	
that's not true of all bars	
juice bars, for example	
oh good point, amy	
yeah, building	
on your premise,	
leonard could frequent sushi bars, salad bars, oyster bars,	
the apple genius bar	
what are you doing	
keep going i'm listening	
that was rude	
he does it all the time	
he's a cornucopia of social awkwardness	
cornucopia	
what a mellifluous word	
let's make that our word of the day	
agreed and we'll use mellifluous tomorrow	
well, i have to void my bladder	
it was nice spending this time with you	
amy	
wait	
i have a request	
yes	
i'd like you to meet my mother	
i see	
can i get back to you on that	
certainly good night	
good night	
leonard, leonard, leonard,	
leonard, leonard,	
leonard, leonard,	
leonard, leonard, leonard,	
leonard, leonard, leonard,	
leonard, leonard,	
leonard, leonard,	
leonard, leonard	
yeah, what	
amy farrah fowler has asked me	
to meet her mother	
yeah so	
what does that mean	
well, you know	
how you're always saying	
that amy is a girl	
who's your friend,	
and not your girlfriend	
uhhuh	
you can't say that anymore	
wait what	
look, she obviously wants to take your relationship to the next level	
i don't want the next level	
i like this level	
fix it for me	
me	
well, how am i supposed	to fix it	
simple you want a girlfriend,	
amy wants to be someone's girlfriend	
take her off my hands	
i give you my blessing	
that is insane	
you're right	
it would never work	
amy finds you tedious	
okay, good luck	
wait what am i	
supposed to do	
well, have you considered telling her how you feel	
leonard, i'm a physicist,	
not a hippie	
all right, well, let me see	
if i can explain your situation	using physics	
what would you be	
if you were attached to another object	
by an inclined plane wrapped	
helically around an axis	
screwed	
there you go	
amy's right	
he is tedious	
mrs wolowitz	
howard, get the door	
wolowitz	
why can't you get it	
mrs wolowitz	
you know i'm doing a bowel cleanse for my colonoscopy	
i'm like an upsidedown volcano here	
oh, hey	
i hope you didn't hear that	
the volcano thing no	
what's with the tshirt	
you working at the	
apple store now	
no, it's just something	
i threw on	
i know all your shirts	
that's not one of them	
you were pretending to work at the genius bar to pick up women,	
weren't you	
yeah	
turns out,	
they guard the ipods,	
but they don't guard the shirts	
so, how'd it go	
it was going well	
i was showing	
this super hot girl	
how to boot up in safe mode	
the manager got suspicious,	
and, well, long story short,	
they really do have a little jail in the mall	
just fyi, don't try to go back with a fake mustache	
i mean, they may not really be geniuses,	
but they see right through that	
i want to invoke the girlfriend pact, howard	
you that desperate	
no, i just	
i want what you have	
you know, i want	
a woman in my life	
mrs wolowitz	
holy moses,	
how much liquid can be in one tokus	
to be clear, i meant like	
bernadette, not your mother	
yeah, i know	
what you mean	
well, i'm off to meet	
bernadette's friend	
how do i look	
as if one of the plants	from invasion of the body snatchers duplicated you in every way,	
only with an absurd	
amount of hair gel	
what are you	
working on	
i'm removing	
my digital footprint	
from the internet	
so amy farrah fowler	
can't find me	
and compel me to meet her mother	
ah	
you're going off the grid	
exactly	
the old unabomber approach	
kudos	
thank you	
i've also sent amy a	
relationship termination notice	
and changed my cell phone number	
and email address	
what if she just comes over	
she'll get lost	
we no longer live at  los robles	
we now live at  los robles	
you changed the address	on the building	
what about mail	
oh, no worries	
i explained my predicament to our letter carrier	
he was sympathetic	
his exact words were	
"got your back, jack	
bitches be crazy"	
who is it	
amy farrah fowler	
darn she found me	
she's been here before	
the only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan	
now, get my back, jack	
what do you want to do	
tell her i'm not here	
okay, where are you	
i don't know	
you'll have to devise a scenario	
that plausibly explains my absence,	
keeping in mind that the key to a good lie lies in the details	
hi, amy	
sheldon's not here	
all right	
way to go on the details	
thanks again for	
doing this, bernadette	
oh, i take pacts	
very seriously	
one time at my lab,	
a petri dish of genetically modified	
supervirus went missing	
that day we made a pinky swear	
never to admit	
we crossed ebola with the common cold	
why the hell	
would you cross ebola	
with the common cold	
we never did	
that would be a terrible, terrible thing	
hi sorry i'm late	
i was at the gym	
spin class	
worked up quite a sweat	
joy, this is leonard	
leonard, this is joy	
hi	
hi	
you don't look	
like a genius	
go ahead, say something smart	
uh	
aah time's up	
joy	
just kidding	
first thing you need	
to know about me	
i'm hilarious	
yeah	
leonard	
so, bernadette tells me	
she knows you from	
selfdefense classes	
yeah israeli krav maga	
lots of fun	
basically,	
a hundred different ways to rip a guy's nuts off	
leonard	
wow wouldn't think there'd be that many	
number	
whoa	
isn't she a pip	
proxima centauri's the nearest star	
the celestial bodies that follow are alpha centauri a, toli,	
barnard's star,	
wolf	
lalande ,	
sirius a, sirius b,	
blceti, uvceti,	
ross	
ross	
epsilon eridani,	
lac,	
ross ,	
procyon a	
oh, darn, that's wrong	
ez aquarii a,	
ez aquarii b,	
ez aquarii c,	
procyon a	
those are the stars	
that are nearest to me	
tralala and fiddledeedee	
oh, dear	
they really do be crazy	
this lobster's good	
on the way down	
and the way up	
should be it's	
$ a pound	
hey, this is a date, right	
yep, it is	
whoa	
excuse me, i have to go	
to the little girls' room	
and take a wicked whiz	
i'll go with you	
fair warning	
i had the asparagus	
my pea is gonna	stink up the place	
i think she likes you	
ez aquarii b	
ez aquarii c	
excuse me, madam	
sheldon	
rats	
i believe a misunderstanding	
may have occurred	
when i asked you to meet my mother	
no misunderstanding	
i've learned what that request actually means,	
and i don't want to be joined to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis	
in what way are	you screwed	
all i want to do is present you	
as my boyfriend to my mother	
so she'll be satisfied	
that i'm in a relationship	
so we'd be	
perpetrating a ruse	
precisely	
and you haven't fallen hopelessly in love with me	
don't be absurd	
i find the notion of romantic love to be an unnecessary cultural construct	
that adds no value to human relationships	
amy farrah fowler, that's the most pragmatic thing	
anyone has ever said to me	
i trust this clarification allows us to return to boyslashfriendslash girlslashfriend status	
of course	
would you like to join me for chinese food	
sheldon, please,	
you're suffocating me	
my apologies	
good night, amy	
good night, sheldon	
come on, just give her a chance	
maybe she'll grow on you	
or maybe she'll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off	
there are still  ways	
she hasn't tried yet	
look, hhoward,	
i appreciate the effort, but this is, like,	
the worst date of my life	
seriously	
i was once robbed by a preop	
transsexual i met on jdate,	
and that didn't	even crack my top ten	
i guess the difference is, i have some selfrespect	
not that i've ever seen	
it's relatively new	
i just know that	
i'm not gonna spend time with someone i don't like	
simply to have a girlfriend	
i'm okay on my own	
good news i made	
lots of room for dessert	
look, uh, joy, it was nice	
to meet you, but	
yeah, you, too	
hey, you got anything for next weekend	
i need a date for	
my cousin's wedding	
you're asking me out	
joy	
yeah	
and it's an open bar,	
so i'll probably be giving it away	
i look forward to it	
mrs fowler	
it's nice to meet you, too, sheldon	
i honestly didn't believe amy	
when she told me	
she had a boyfriend	
i assure you i am quite real	
and i'm having regular intercourse	
with your daughter	
what	
oh, yes	
we're like wild	
animals in heat	
it's a wonder neither of us has been hurt	
amy what is he saying	
you wanted me to have a boyfriend, mother	
well, here he is	
have to sign off now	
my hunger for sheldon is stirring in my loins	
oh, yes, it's time for me to make love to your daughter's vagina	
thank you, sheldon,	
that went very well	
agreed	
amy, i find myself wondering	
if we should actually engage in coitus at least one time in our relationship	
bazinga	
bedtime please show yourself out
