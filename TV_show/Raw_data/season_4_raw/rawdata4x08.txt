okay, help me out here	
how does an archeology professor get that good with a whip	
maybe he took a class	
at the adult bookstore	
that's how i learned	
i can't believe you've never	
seen raiders of the lost ark	
and i can't believe you've	
never read eat, pray, love	
when she comes out with	eat, pray, run away from a	
giant boulder, i'll read it	
i don't care if eat, pray, love	
changed your life,	
i'm not reading it	
you know, i could totally rock a hat like that	
that's the work of noted	
hollywood costume designer	
deborah nadoolman	
she also designed	
the iconic red and black jacket	
in michael jackson's	
thriller video,	
which i've never viewed	
in its entirety,	
as i find zombies dancing	
in choreographed synchronicity	
implausible	
and also, it's really scary	
would someone please turn off the sheldon commentary track	
there's no switch	
just listen and learn	
penny, if you think	
this is good,	
you should come with us friday to see it on the big screen at the colonial	
well, i'm watching it now	
why would i want to see it again	
on friday	
because the print	
they're showing on friday	
has an additional  seconds	
of previously unseen footage	
seconds that'll be like	
seeing a whole new movie	
exactly	
they say it finally solves	
the submarine controversy	
did leonard	
i'm no expert, but i believe	
what we just heard from penny	
was sarcasm	
oh good	
i'm eight for  this month	
yeah, i think i'll pass	
but you guys enjoy	
your extra  seconds	
bet if i could	
make you understand	
why this is such a cool thing,	
we'd still be together	
mm, yeah, no,	
we wouldn't	
uhhuh	
i'm guessing  seconds had	
something to do with that, too	
may i point out to you all	
that the screening is	
"first come, first served"	
relax, it's  the movie	
doesn't start till midnight	
another way of saying that is	
"the movie starts at midnight,	
and it's already "	
let's go	
you know, if we miss it,	
we'll have the fun of	
listening to sheldon whine about	
it for the rest of our lives see howard's on my side	
actually, i'm not	
i'm using sarcasm to mock you	
drat now i'm  for	
don't worry, sheldon	
we'll be fine	
what happened to the leonard hofstadter	
who waited in line	
with me for  hours	
to see the midnight premiere	
of star trek nemesis	
oh well, he waited	
in line for  hours,	
while you napped	
in a lawn chair,	
he got in a fight	
with a klingon	
when he stepped	
out of line to pee	
and you wouldn't wake up	
to vouch for him,	
and worst of all,	
he saw star trek nemesis	
but how were our seats	
excellent	
i rest my case	
amy, don't you agree we should	
leave now and get in line	
actually, as the newest member	
of your social group,	
i believe i'll gain more	
acceptance by arbitrarily	
siding with your friends	
from time to time	
shrewd	
leonard, you're right	
we should enjoy our meal, arrive late,	
and risk winding up	
with terrible seats,	
assuming we get in at all	
thank you, amy	
see it's working	
knockknock	
who's there	
olive	
olive you, too	
guys, that's really	
starting to get old	
knockknock	
who's there	
i have a girlfriend	
and you don't	
hysterical	
wait, now, we don't know	
that yet he isn't finished	
i have a girlfriend	
and you don't who	
so are you sure you don't want	
to come with us to raiders	
oh, no that movie has melting faces	
it reminds me	
too much of the time	
i dropped that vial of	
flesheating bacteria	
into the rhesus monkey lab	
besides, penny and i are having	
a girls' night tonight	
girls' night	
what does that entail	
oh, you know, girls get	
together,	
hang out, share girl talk	
i'm a girl	
oh well, maybe you can join us	
i'll ask penny	
no need penny and i	
are very close	
you are	
yes in fact,	
our menses are synchronized	
penny	
bernadette tells me you're	
planning a girls' night	
yeah	
i'm a girl	
oh um, it was it was just	
going to be me and bernadette	
besides, i thought you	
were going to the movies	
with sheldon and the guys	
yes, but they're not girls	
i'm a girl	
yeah, no, no,	
iii got that	
what's the dress code	
uh, just wear something comfortable	
all right	
i'll have to go shopping	
knockknock	
who is there	
hugh	
hugh who	
hugh people need to listen to me	
it's time to get in line for the movie	
and that's how you tell	
a knockknock joke	
under normal circumstances	
i'd say, "i told you so"	
but as i have told you so	
with such vehemence	
and frequency already,	
the phrase has lost all meaning	
therefore, i will be	
replacing it with the phrase	
"i informed you thusly"	
ooh can't wait	
for that to start	
i informed you thusly	
eight for	
this is where we could have been	
if we hadn't stopped for dinner	
this is where we could have been	
if koothrappali	
hadn't ordered dessert	
well i earned it, dude,	
i ate all my broccoli	
and here's where we are	
the runts in a large litter	
unlikely to ever reach	
the nourishing teats	
of indiana jones	
so i guess it's a good thing	
we stopped for dinner	
you know, guys, when	
facing disappointment,	
eat, pray, love  teaches us	
oh, shut up	
so anyway, to make	
a long story short,	
turns out i have	
an unusually firm cervix	
you	
amy, when we say "girl talk,"	
it doesn't just have to	
be about our lady parts	
shame 'cause i have a real	
zinger about my titled uterus	
penny, your nails look great	
oh, thanks i found	
this place in alhambra	
it's in a woman's basement	
i think it's a front	
for human trafficking,	
but they do a really good job	
a colleague of mine did her	
graduate thesis on the fungus	
that grows on improperly	
sterilized manicure implements	
well don't tell me that's not "girl talk"	
so where should	
we go tonight	
a bar a club a movie	
or we could just stay here	
yes, and continue to bond	
i have a feeling	
that after tonight,	
one of you will become	
my best friend forever	
or "bff," if you prefer	
which i don't	
all right, time to open	
bachelor number two	
gee, i don't know	
if i should drink more	
i have to drive home,	
and i've got enough trouble	
seeing over the dashboard	
as it is	
that's okay	
you can just sleep here	
oh, good, a slumber party	
we'll do makeovers,	
initiate phony phone calls,	
and have spirited pillow fights	
in our frilly nighties	
oh, gosh, amy	
i don't know if i would call	
this an actual slumber party	
well, that's disappointing	
i've always wanted to be	
invited to a slumber party	
oh, you never were	
not even when	
you were a kid	
well, there was the time	
i had my tonsils out,	
and i shared a room with	
a little vietnamese girl	
she didn't make it	
through the night,	
but up till then,	
it was kind of fun	
okay well, i guess we're	
having a slumber party	
oh	
pillow fight	
oh, i hope they	
let us in soon	
i'm tired of running to the gas	
station to use the bathroom	
the guy makes me buy	
a gatorade every time	
it's a vicious circle	
too bad you don't have	
a stadium pal like me	
what's a stadium pal	
let me put it this way	
takes care of	
the bathroom problem,	
and it keeps your calf warm	
hey, guys, bad news	
i just did a quick calculation	
given the size of the theater	
and the length of this line,	
we might not get seats	
what did he say	
nice going, raj	
just got him down for his nap	
we might not get seats	
it's fine, it's fine	
go back to sleep	
oh, i informed you thusly	
i so informed you thusly	
howard, you talk to him	
howard	
you're peeing,	
aren't you	
hey, look who's here	
hey, buddies	
well, if it isn't wil wheaton,	
the jar jar binks	
of the star trek universe	
meesa think that very funny	
well, yousa can go think that at the back of the line	
no cuts, no buts, no coconuts	
wil wheaton	
yeah	
i'm a big fan	
of what poorly	
executed beards	
do you think you could get me and my friends into the movie	
we got here	
a little late	
no problem 	
come on,	
i'll hook you up	
awesome	
wesa gonna go into	
the movie now byebye	
this is indiana jones,	
not star trek	
there should be no value	
to his pseudocelebrity here	
and even at	
star trek conventions,	
they only let him in	
if he helps set up	
calm down, sheldon	
i will not calm down	
this affront to justice and	
decency cannot go unanswered	
as captain jeanluc picard	
once said,	
"the line must be drawn here	
"this far, no farther"	
had to wake him up	
from his nap, didn't you	
you know what i really love	
about howard	
his chest hair	
howard has a hairy chest	
no, just the one	
but it's really long	
okay, there you go	
sultry sunrise red	
what do you think	
my nails have never	
looked so pretty before	
get it off	
oh, oh, uh, looks like	
they're getting ready	
to let people in listen to what mr wil wheaton is tweeting	
"best seats in house	
for raiders screening	
suck on that, sheldon cooper"	
why do you read	
his twitter feed	
you know it's only	
going to upset you	
i believe in knowing	
my enemy, leonard	
had twitter existed at the time,	
would not general custer	
have followed the tweets	
of sitting bull	
would not lee have	
followed grant	
would not spy have followed spy	
i have more examples,	
but excuse me	
hello	
well, this seems	
like an odd time	
to test my cell phone quality,	
but go on	
test phrases all right	
imatote	
ulba	
twad	
all together	
i'm a total buttwad	
why are you laughing	
hello	
and that, girls, is how you make	
a phony phone call	
i'm not sure i grasp	
the full entertainment value,	
but all right	
next on wikipedia's list	
of slumber party activities	
"truth or dare"	
okay, it's your game	
you go first	
hang on i'm familiarizing	
myself with the rules	
seems fairly straightforward	
bernadette, truth or dare	
truth	
all right	
to what temperature	
must you heat beef	
in order to	
kill the prion	
that causes bovine	
spongiform encephalopathy	
um	
remember, you have to answer honestly	
wait no, amy, you're	
supposed to ask her	
something personal	
or embarrassing	
oh	
all right	
what is the circumference	
of your areolas	
"munching on	
complimentary popcorn	
woot, woot"	
oh, the gall	
i hope his next tweet is	
"popcorn lodged in trachea	
"choking to death	
woot, woot"	
guys, i am sorry	
we are full up	
no	
we're full up	
we really want	
to see this	
isn't there anything you can do	
sorry fire regulations	
should've gotten here earlier	
this is nothing but a	
blatant abuse of power	
by a petty functionary	
explain to me why wil wheaton and his lackeys get in and we don't	
'cause i'm the petty functionary	
with a clipboard, bitch	
i guess that's that	
let's go home	
you know what	
i'm going back to	
"i told you so"	
i told you so	
we can still see something	
oh, the new sandra bullock movie	
is playing two blocks away	
you know sandy b	
always brings it	
look a side door	
come on, short round	
i guess we'd better	
go after him	
short round	
indy's young sidekick	
from temple of doom	
yeah, i know who it	
is, but why is it me	
you're right it should	
be a cuddly asian boy	
like me	
"and absolon hath	
kist hir nether ye,	
"and nicholas is scalded	
in the towte	
this tale is doon,	
and god save al the rowte"	
what the hell was that	
bernadette dared me to	
tell a dirty story	
"the miller's tale" by chaucer	
is the dirtiest story i know	
it would have been hidden	
in sock drawers	
if people in the th century	
had worn socks	
i thought it was pretty spicy	
especially the part	
where he kisses her nether ye	
you might not	
like it as much	
if you knew what	
"nether ye" meant	
if one cares	
about hygiene,	
one ought not be kissing it	
okay, my turn	
penny, truth or dare	
truth	
why are you still hanging out	
with leonard so much	
even though you broke up	
with him	
oh, that's an	
excellent question	
for two people who claim to be	
no longer pairbonded,	
you spend an inordinate amount	
of time in each other's company	
yeah	
dare	
i don't believe the rules allow	
for an ex post facto	
option change	
yeah	
okay, look, just because we're	
not seeing each other anymore	
doesn't mean	
we can't be friends	
i mean, leonard's a great guy	
then, why did you terminate	
your relationship with him	
i don't know	
he got really serious,	
and i wasn't ready for it	
interesting	
how will you react	
if, in the future,	
you become ready for it,	
and leonard is unavailable,	
because another woman	
has realized that he is	
to use your words	
"a great guy"	
you can only ask one question	
that one	
you know what,	
i don't want to play anymore	
well, i'm not sure	
how this is scored,	
but i believe	
we may have won	
sheldon	
sheldon	
where did he go	
we're looking for sheldon,	
not marmaduke	
you whistled	
what is that	
raiders of the lost ark	
with  additional seconds	
if i can't see it,	
no one else can see it	
sheldon, this is crazy	
no crazy was leaving	
the projection booth unattended	
listen to me	
you are overtired	
you're not thinking right	
put the movie back before we get into trouble	
trouble is my middle name,	
leonard	
actually, it's lee,	
but i prefer trouble	
oh, look who	
they let in	
don't worry, wil wheaton	
i was just leaving	
come on, short round	
yeah	
come on, guys	
hurry up hurry up	
let's see you run	
with a bag of urine	
strapped to your leg	
he's got the movie, get him	
why is there never a pontoon	
plane when you need one	
she's been in there	
a long time	
clearly, losing truth or dare	
upset her	
perhaps we should try to take her mind off it with another popular slumber party activity	
ooh, like what	
well, the internet suggests	
that slumber party guests	
often engage	
in harmless experimentation	
with lesbianism	
where exactly on the internet	
have you been looking	
penny	
oh, hey, amy	
look, i'm sorry i got	
so upset i just	
whoa, whoa, whoa	
what are you doing	
don't worry	
i;ll avoid the nether ye	
i might have gone	
with eating raw cookie dough
