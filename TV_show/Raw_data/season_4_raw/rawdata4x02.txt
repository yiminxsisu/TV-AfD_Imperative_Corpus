whatcha doin' there	
working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner	
the humorous implication being that i am wile e coyote	
yes	
and this is a schematic for a birdtrapping device	
that will ultimately backfire	
and cause me physical injury	
yes	
what i'm doing here is trying to determine when i'm going to die	
a lot of people are working on that research	
so what is all this	
my family history	
factoring in longevity,	
propensity for disease,	
et cetera	
interesting	
cause of death for	
uncle carl was kbb	
what's "kbb"	
"killed by badger"	
how's that	
it was thanksgiving	
uncle carl said, "i think	
"there's a badger living in our chimney	hand me that flashlight"	
those were the last words	
he ever spoke to us	
i don't think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary	
not true	
the fight or flight instinct	
is coded genetically	
instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family	
who's to say that i don't share	
that flawed dna	
you can always get a badger and find out	
but seriously,	
even if i disregard the uncle carl factor,	
at best i have  years left	
that long, huh	
only takes me to here	
i need to get to here	
what's there	
the earliest estimate of the singularity,	
when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality	
so, you're upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish selfaware robot	
by this much	
tough break	
you want eggs	
you don't get it, leonard	
i'm going to miss so much	
the unified field theory, cold fusion, the dogapus	
what's a dogapus	
the hybrid dog and octopus	
man's underwater best friend	
is somebody working on that	
i was going to	
i planned on giving it to myself	
on my th birthday	
wait a minute	
you hate dogs	
a dogapus can play fetch with eight balls	
no one can hate that	
what do we owe you	
it came to $	
let's say six bucks apiece	
here you go	
thank you	
what	
never mind i got it	
oh, you wanted me to pay	
it's no big deal	
no, no, no, no	
we're not going out anymore	
i should pay for myself	
what	
he said, "if he had woman parts, he'd eat for free, the rest of his life"	
yeah, but you wouldn't be able to talk to yourself	
i'm a little low on cash	
how much you got	
nothing	
how can you walk around with no money	
i'm cute i get by	
it's okay,	
you can owe me	
thank you	
sheldon, six bucks	
no, thank you	
i'm not eating pizza tonight	
but it's thursday	
thursday's pizza night	
not for me	
thursday is now cruciferous	
vegetable night	
tonight's selection	
brussels sprouts	
really	
you're changing the sheldonian calendar	
it's a small price to pay	
for what	
no, no, don't ask	
sorry, sorry, sorry,	
sorry, sorry	
in order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics,	
i need to change my diet	
wait cybernetics is robot stuff, right	
correct	
so you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot	
essentially, yes	
okay, here's my question	
didn't you already do that	
no	
flattering, but sadly, no	
i'm also planning to begin an exercise regimen designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system	
aka jogging	
wait honey,	
have you ever run before	
certainly	
i've run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens	
and one particularly persistent pe teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test	
you're right	
penny jogs	
maybe you guys can run together	
that's an excellent idea	
yeah, if we chat,	
it will create the illusion of time going faster	
no, it won't	
um, how does he know i jog	
oh, he watches you from his car	with highpowered binoculars	
oh, my god, that is so creepy	
i know	
and he says he's not gonna stop	then see a shrink and figure out how to talk to women	
what the hell	
what's the matter	
i have pain radiating from my navel to my lower right abdomen	
i'm nauseated and feverish	
i believe i may have cholera	
there's no cholera in pasadena	
just like last summer,	
when there was no malaria in pasadena	
well, if it's not cholera,	
then based on a quick internet search,	
the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are hirschsprung's disease, botulism, a foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms	
when would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms	
it's part of an	unlikely scenario	
that involves sleepwalking	
and a hour flower mart	with a lessthan	vigilant proprietor	
oh, lord, my belly	
ever had your appendix out	
i haven't	
i've been meaning to,	
but who has the time	
let's get you to the hospital	
so this is how it ends	
with cruel irony	
just as i make the commitment to preserving my body,	
i am betrayed by my appendix,	a vestigial organ	
do you know	
the original purpose of the appendix, leonard	
no	
i do and yet i'm doomed	
while you live on	
funny how things	
work out, isn't it	
oh, lord, i think	
it's about to burst	
on the other hand,	
it might have been the brussels sprouts	
good night	
good night	
appendicitis	
what a nervous nelly	
penny penny	
penny	
coming, coming	
hey, nice knees	
thank you	
they're my mother's	
oh	
and the flash shirt is what	
because, what,	
you're gonna run really fast	
no, the flash shirt is	
because it's friday,	
but it's nice when things work out	
where's your heart rate monitor	
i don't have one	
what about your pedometer	
don't have one	
do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an ipod	
uh, no	
what do you do,	
you just go out there	
and gambol about	
like a bunny	
no i just run till i'm hungry,	
then i stop for a bear claw	
why are you doing that	
it's good to stretch your muscles before you run	
all right	
all right,	
let's start with a toe touch	
okay, you do it	
i am doing it	
oh wow good job	
okay, um,	
can you do this	
we'll never know	
okay, let's just warm up on the run	
okay	
okay, let's go	
i've been reading up on biomechanics	
i think you'll be surprised at my	
penny	
oh, my god,	
are you okay	
sheldon	
i think so	
oh, let me help you up	
thank you	
oh, sheldon	
if it makes you	feel any better,	
thursday is no longer cruciferous vegetable night	
here's my chicken curry	
howard, your shrimp biryani	
thank you, sir	
palak paneer,	
that's penny	
thanks	
and for rajesh koothrappali,	
from whose homeland	
these tasty dishes originate, one large order of chicken mcnuggets	
hey, what's my share	
uh  bucks	
okay, can i get you after friday	
when i get paid	
sure	
what am i up to now	
well, okay, with the indian food, the pizza, the thai food, the tank of gas, the frozen yogurt	
and your rent, uh	
a little over $,	
what now	
he's just expressing his admiration that you don't even have to put out to get free stuff	
it's not free i'm gonna pay him back	
shut up	
sheldon, are you gonna join us	
coming	
greetings, friends	
greetings, whatever the hell you are	
i am a mobile virtual presence device	
recent events	
have demonstrated to me	
that my body is too fragile	
to endure the vicissitudes of the world	
until such time as i am able	
to transfer my consciousness,	
i shall remain in a secure location	
and interact with the world	
in this manner	
really that's your question	
when did he put a ramp in	
you're in my spot	
this may seem a little odd	
at first,	
but over time,	
you'll grow accustomed to dealing with me in this configuration	
yeah, to be honest, i don't see much difference	
thank you	
that's what i was going for	
now, leonard, tomorrow,	
when we go to work,	
you'll need to allow some extra time to get me down the stairs	
for your convenience,	
i disassemble into four pieces	
this is ridiculous	
i'm coming to talk to you	
you don't know where i am	
my physical body is safely ensconced in a secure, undisclosed location	
you're in your bedroom	
no, i'm not	
i can hear your voice coming from your bedroom	
no, you can't	
wait	
come back	
halt	
authorized personnel only	
so, either one of you weirdos want to buy my underwear	
only , bucks	
sheldon,	
this is ridiculous	
i'm behind you	
please look at me when you're talking to me	
i am looking at you	
no, you're not	
pay no attention to that man in the bed	
you cannot exist as a virtual presence	
not here	
and certainly not at work	
oh, good god	
at my age,	
do you know how i'm statistically most likely to die at the hands of your roommate	
an accident that's how i'm going to make it look	
until i can transfer my intellect to a more durable container,	
my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed	
fine, but don't expect my help	
you have to help	
it's in the roommate agreement	
no, it's not	
section c	
the various obligations	
and duties of the parties	
in the event one of them becomes a robot	
i'll be damned	
this is delightful	
uhhuh	
it's much easier to enjoy the picturesque route	we travel to work	
when you remove the specter of fiery vehicular death	
refresh my memory	
why didn't i just put you	
in the trunk	
because i called shotgun	
remember	
right	
you seem tense	
perhaps this will relax you	
i don't want to listen to music, sheldon	
very well	
i don't understand	
why you're not enjoying this	
together, in this car,	
with my enhanced capabilities,	
we're like knight rider	
except in knight rider, the car	
isn't a yammering sphincter	
you mock the sphincter,	
but the sphincter is a class of muscle without which human beings couldn't survive	
there are over different sphincters in the human body	
how many can you name	
i was wrong this is exactly	
like knight rider	
perhaps you'd be interested in a different game	
no	
this is a photograph of the solvay conference on the theory of radiation and quanta using photoshop, i've introduced a few anachronisms	
see if you can spot all	
i'll give you the first one	
madame curie should not	be wearing a digital watch	
and go	
that's it byebye	
bazinga	
whoa	
i have an override switch	
i almost died	
and i'm safe and sound in bed	
who's crazy now	
i'm still going to go with you	
hello, professor hoskins	
nice to see you, mindy	
and konnichiwa, dr nakamora	
sorry the swedes	
disproved your theory	
leonard, my door	
what about it	
be a lamb and open it for me	
why what's the problem	
you think you have me stymied,	
don't you	
no, i think a doorknob has you stymied	
oh, look, it's leonard	
and rdbag	
that's my joke	
i told it last night	
you can't just use it	
raj, be a lamb	
and open the door for me	
oh, sure	
he's a lamb	
you're not	
i'm a lamb	
isn't this nice	
the pleasures of fellowship	
and camaraderie	without having to tolerate	
your germy breath on my skin	
i say we just take him	to tatooine	
and sell him to some jawas	
that's two, dude	
write your own jokes	
oh, great	
hi, i'm penny,	
i'll be your waitress	
why are you introducing	
yourself	
i'd rather people not know	
i have any prior connection to you whatsoever	
can you tell me	
the specials this evening	
sheldon, i'm not waiting on you	
obviously	
i don't even have water yet	
because you're not here	
that's discrimination against the otherwise located	
i'm going to have	
to go over your head manager manager	
oh, lord,	
look who it is	
is that steve wozniak	
i think it is the great and powerful woz	
penny,	
steve wozniak was one of the cofounders of apple computer	
he and steve jobs started it	
yeah,	
i know who he is	
i watch dancing with the stars	
i must speak to him	
of course you must	
you know, there's an olive garden down the street	
you guys should try it sometime	
excuse me,	
mr wozniak	
oh, hey	
nice virtual presence device	
thank you	
i just want to say	
i'm a big fan	
you're my th favorite technological visionary	
only th	
it's still six spots	
above steve jobs	
i care neither for turtlenecks	
nor showmanship	
yeah, i never got that turtleneck thing	
one of my proudest possessions is a vintage  apple two	
despite the file system	
limitations of apple dos ,	
it was a pretty nifty little achievement	
thanks, we were shooting	
for "nifty"	
you know, if you had it here,	
i'd autograph it for you	
don't move for 
depending on how the buses are running	
nerds	
i'm coming, woz, i'm coming	
ow	
oh	
aw	
penny penny penny	
what up, shelbot	
i can't get out of bed	
i hurt my ankle	
what do you want me to do	
sing me "soft kitty"	
really, you want me	
to sing "soft kitty"	
to a computer monitor	
would you rather come over	
and sing it to me in person	
♪ soft kitty, warm kitty ♪
