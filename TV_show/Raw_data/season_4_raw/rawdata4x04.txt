i'm telling you, if xenon emits	
ultraviolet light,	
then those dark matter	
discoveries must be wrong	
yes, well, if we lived in a world	
where slowmoving xenon produced light,	
then you'd be correct	
also, pigs would fly,	
my derriere would produce cotton candy,	
and the phantom menace would be a timeless classic	
oh, you're so arrogant	
if you were a superhero,	
your name would be captain arrogant	
and you know	
what your superpower would be arrogance	
you're wrong again	
if my superpower were arrogance,	
my name would be dr arroganto	
i love watching raj and sheldon	try to work together	
yeah, it's like	
if alien and predator decided to go partners in a jamba juice	
has it occurred to you	
you're missing the big picture	
if you look at neutron scattering data	
oh, penny	
penny	
what's up	
nothing i just wanted to make raj stop talking	
no, no, no	
he won	
suck it up	
well, i'd ask you guys	
if you want dessert,	
but i know sheldon doesn't eat dessert on tuesdays	
and even if raj wanted something, he couldn't tell me	
howard won't order anything,	
but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment involving the words pie or cheesecake	
and leonard's lactose intolerant,	
so he can't eat anything here without his intestines blowing up	
like a balloon animal	
hang on a second	
i could have the fruit platter	
you want the fruit platter	
does it have melon	
on it	
yeah	
no, i can't eat melon	
oh, howard,	
heads up	
your exgirlfriend just came in for her shift	
when was the last time	
you saw her	
oh, not since we broke up	
wow how am i going to play this	sophisticated and relaxed	
friendly, noncommittal	
cold and distant	
hi, guys	
hey	
hello	
i see you decided to go	with pathetic and frightened	
it's one of his best moves	
so, my dear, we meet again	
hello, howard	
i've missed you	
i've missed you, katee sackhoff	
one question	
anything	
why am i wearing my battlestar galactica flight suit in bed	
why are you in bed with me	
if we start to question this,	
it all falls apart	
sorry	
oh, ravish me, howard	
my loins ache for you	
okay, if you insist mrs wolowitz	
howard, have you seen my girdle	
no, ma	
i can't find it, and i'm late for my weight watchers meeting	
maybe it committed suicide	
leave me alone	
now, where were we	
i believe you were about to rip off my uniform with your teeth	
bernadette	
what are you doing here	
well, if i had to	
guess, i'd say i'm here	
because you saw me earlier this evening,	
and you're still hung up on me	
no, i'm not	
clearly you are	
otherwise, based on past experience,	
we'd be done by now	
okay,	
i'm a little confused here	
george takei	
oh, my	
can i help	
not that kind of confused	
what's george	
takei doing here	
howard, do you have latent homosexual tendencies	
no, of course not	
so you say	
yet, here i am	
george, let me	ask you something	
how did you deal with being typecast as a science fiction icon	
it's difficult	
you try and stretch as an actor	
do strindberg, o'neill,	
but all they want is,	
"course laid in, captain"	
tell me about it	
it's frackin' frustrating	
wait katee,	
why are you leaving	
she's leaving because you really want to be with me	
mrs wolowitz	
howard, i found my girdle	
it was in the dryer	
great, ma	
i think it shrunk	
i'm spilling out like the pillsbury doughboy here and with that mental picture,	
i think we're done for the evening	
you know, you never told me what happened between you and bernadette	
i did a stupid thing	
yeah, i guessed that	
it was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now	
that covers anything from farting in bed to killing a homeless guy	
oh, my god	
you ran over a hobo	
no	
stop asking	
all right, fine so you want to get back together with her,	
but you're too ashamed to face her	
because of whatever	
it is you did in a nutshell	
okay	
well, how about this	
kidnap bernadette from the opera wearing a creepy mask so she doesn't know it's you	
now, you see, i don't know	
if you're kidding or not	
you're being unreasonable	
why can't	
i have a desk	
our collaboration is a work of the mind	
we don't need desks	
you have a desk	
correct	
but i can't have one	
you're two for two	
why can't he have a desk,	
sheldon	
oh, lord, will	
this day never end	
as i've explained repeatedly to dr koothrappali,	
whose ability to comprehend the american idiom fails him	
when it's convenient,	
there's absolutely	
no money	
in my budget for additional office furniture	
oh, but there's money	
for a drawer full of red vines,	
a marshmallow shooting rifle,	
and a super executive ant farm	
with glowinthedark sand	
yes	
okay, what if he buys his own desk	
yeah, what	
if i buy my own desk	
that's ridiculous	
why	
because	
yes	
it's my office	
sheldon	
all right, all right	
he can buy his own desk	
and i can put it in your office	
well, you really want to dot the i's and cross	
the t's, don't you	
why would you want a glowinthedark ant farm	
they do some of their best work at night	
ah, it's okay	
penny	
penny	
penny	
penny	
would you have opened the door	
if you knew it was me not since i found out the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it	
i just have a question	
does bernadette	ever talk about me	
oh, absolutely	
she does	
yeah, sure	
just yesterday, she asked,	
"why is howard hiding under the table"	
she saw that, huh	
oh, no, not at first	
right after i pointed it out	
let me ask you something else	
is she seeing anybody	
oh, not that i know of	
hey, while we're on the subject,	
why did you guys break up	
anyway	
oh, i'd rather not say	
howard, if you want my help, i've got to know what happened	
but it's embarrassing	
yeah, that's what	
i'm counting on	
spill	
okay well, you know world of warcraft	
um, the online game sure	
well, did you know that the characters in the game can have sex with each other	
oh, god i think	
i see where this is going	
her name was glissinda the troll	
bernadette walked in on me	
while we were doing the cybernasty under the bridge of souls	
oh, you're right	
that is so embarrassing	
would you talk to her	
bernadette or the troll	
bernadette she was so mad at me,	
she wouldn't even listen to my side of the story	
well, what was your side	
well, for all we know,	
glissinda the troll wasn't even a real woman	
i mean, she could've been a yearold truck driver in new jersey	
really and that didn't make her feel better	
will you talk to her, see if there's any chance at all we could get back together	
oh, gee, howard,	
i really don't want to get in the middle of this	
no why would you	
i'm just another lonely	nerd, living with his mother, trying to find any scrap of happiness he can	
you know, maybe to make up for the fact that his dad left him when he was	
okay, i will think about it	
you know, i've always blamed myself for him leaving	
i always thought it was because	i wasn't the son he wanted	
yeah, i said i'd	
think about it	
i wasn't athletic,	
yeah, i was kind of sickly	
okay, fine look, look,	
i'm calling her now see	
thank you	
so anyway,	
howard asked penny to talk to bernadette,	
and she did,	
and bernadette agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee	
one question	
yeah	
why on earth are you telling me all this	
i don't know	
sometimes your movements are so lifelike,	
i forget you're	not a real boy	
you said i could buy a desk	
this isn't a desk	
this is a brobdingnagian monstrosity	
is that the american idiom for "giant, bigass desk"	
it's actually british	
can you say it again for me	
brobdingnagian	
one more time	
brobdingnagian	
now three times fast	
brobdingnagian, brobdingna	
how did you even	
get it in here	
that's for me, ramon, julio,	
jesus and rodrigo to know	
and you to find out	
all right, you've made your point	
a fine prank, very amusing	
now get it out	
no	
yes	
yes	
no	
yes	
i have three brothers	
and two sisters, sheldon	
i can do this all day	
all right, if you're not going to remove it,	
i'll remove it for you	
knock yourself out	
help me move my desk	
no	
yes	
no	
yes	
no it's too brobdingnagian	
why do you even want this here	
its size is completely disproportionate	to its purpose	
well, seeing as its purpose was to piss you off,	
i'd say it's spoton	
all right, i see	
what's going on	
this is the opening	
salvo in what will be an escalating series of juvenile titfortat exchanges	
well titted	
thank you	
stand by for my upcoming tat	
hey, sheldon	
yes	
no	
see what i did there	
i turned it around	
sorry,	
i had to clock out	
oh, no, that's okay	
how have you been	
okay you know,	
busy, schoolwork you	
same i took a scubadiving course over the summer,	
but it turns out i'm terrified of the ocean	
too bad	
you wouldn't know anybody	
who wants to buy a wet	
suit, boy's large	
yeah, forget it	
not important	
so, are you	
seeing anyone	
well, to be honest, i	
hey, how are we	
doing over here can i	
get you something to drink	
not for me, thanks	
i'm okay	
are you gonna want to order food	
maybe later	
okay	
so, are you seeing anybody	
no	
that's what i told him	
when he asked me	
i hope that's not out of line	
no, it's fine	
penny, can we have a little privacy	
oh i'm sorry	
what about you,	
have you been seeing anybody	
well, you know	
how it is with guys	
i mean, we have needs and	
so you've been seeing other girls	
well, not real girls	
does that mean slutty trolls	
you know, you look thirsty	
i brought you some iced tea	
thank you	
it's passion fruit,	
new on the menu	
i know i work here	
oh, sorry	
yeah, you're right doy	
so, howard,	
yay or nay	
isn't there somewhere else	
you can be	
not where i can hear you guys	
okay, fine	
i'll admit, there are dark,	
sordid little corners of the internet	
where the name wolowizard is whispered in hushed tones	
the only reason i go there,	
the only reason	i've ever gone there	
is because i don't have	
a real woman in my life	
you happy	
yeah, that'll hold me for a while	
howard, you did have a real woman	
i was right there in the next room	
while you were clicking	
that troll's brains out	
yeah, but we weren't	
ii mean, you	
and i never had sex	
yeah	
well, whose fault was that	
complimentary nachos	
you enjoy	
never had sex wow	
what do you mean,	
whose fault was that	
well, we could've	
been having sex,	
but you never made the move	
i didn't think you wanted me to make the move	
howard, a girl doesn't go out with a man like you,	
with your looks,	
your fancy patter	
and your tight hoochie pants	
if she's not expecting him to eventually make the move	
really	
really	
son of a bitch	
hey, this is a little awkward,	
but my manager says	
i can't actually give nachos away	
so just take that when you're ready	
yeah, we had a really great talk,	
and we're gonna start seeing each other again	
oh, congratulations	
have you broken it to the troll yet	
did penny tell you about that	
no steve patterson told me	
the greasy old fat guy in facilities management	
yeah	
how'd he know about it	
he's glissinda the troll	
sorry, dude,	
the thermostat's on my side of the room,	
so it stays mumbai hot in here until you turn off	
that stupid indian music	
i'll turn off the music	
when you get rid of that	
salmonellaridden parakeet	
oh, too bad sheldon's pathologically afraid of birds	
hey, look, sheldon	
birdie, birdie, birdie	
that's it prepare for marshmallow death	
eat flaming nerf	
so anyway	
that's great news about you and bernadette	
yeah i think i'm gonna take her to miniature golf	
ah well, i guess for you guys that's like regular golf short jokes really	
you're, like, a quarter of an inch taller than me	
yeah, and don't	you forget it	
i had a good time	
me, too	
kiss her good night	
all right, now a little tongue	
george takei	
hold on there	
we've only just rekindled	
the romance	
let's not sully the moment	
with the exchange of saliva	
don't listen to him	
she wants it	
tongue	
la, la, la, la, la	
see	
now make the move	
mmmmm	
too soon	
trust me, she's ready	
make the move	
no, no, no	
a lady wants to be wooed,	
courted slowly	
how would you know	
i read	
listen to me, howard, it's time	
make the move, now	
mm what are you doing	
you said well,	
the "move," remember	
oh, not now	
we're starting a	
new relationship	
i need to get to	
know you again	
no, you don't	
it's me	
the lusty charmer with the fancy patter	
and the hoochie pants	
be patient	
we'll get there	
told you	
oh, god, what's that smell	
ohhohoo	
yes	
what are you	
doing in there	
i'm making	
hydrogen sulfide	
and ammonia gas	
just a little experiment	
in pest control	
it's not gonna work, dude	
i grew up in india	
an entire subcontinent	
where cows walk in the street,	
and nobody has ever had	a solid bowel movement	
well, we'll just see	
how long you can hold out	
well, we'll just see how your noxious gas fares	against my cinnamon applescented	
aroma therapy candles	
didn't you say you're	
making hydrogen sulfide gas	
yes	
isn't that flammable	
highly	
oh, dear	
this is not over
