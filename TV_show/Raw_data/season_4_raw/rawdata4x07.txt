no, seriously,	
i think	
i've finally figured out	
my problem with women	
the capybara is the largest	
member of the rodent family	
what does that have to do	
with me and women	
nothing	
it was a desperate attempt	
to introduce an alternate topic	
of conversation	
my problem is,	
i don't project confidence	
so i decided that	
the next time i meet a woman	
i think is attractive,	
rather than holding back	
and being cautious,	
i'm going to assume	
the mantle of selfassurance	
oh, yeah	
what's that look like	
hi	
i'm leonard	
and you are beautiful you pop, sparkle	
and buzz electric	
i'm going to pick you up	
at , show you a night you will never forget	
where are we going	
good news	
i made it	
onto the team	
for the new defense department	
laserequipped	
surveillance satellite	
excuse me	
if we're changing topics,	
i believe i have first dibs	
with capybara, a rodent	
the size of a baby hippo	
congratulations,	
howard	
wolowitz	
thanks	
listen, i have to get a security clearance,	
so you guys might be	
hearing from the fbi	
whoa, whoa, whoa	
i don't want to speak	
to the fbi	
why not	
i'm brown and i talk funny	
they're just doing	
a background check on me	
it doesn't matter	
they'll find a reason	
to give me a oneway ticket	
back to gandhiville	
by the way,	
when i say that,	
it's not offensive	
don't be ridiculous, raj	
you're here legally	
nobody cares	
do you know how long it's been	
since i got through	
airport security	
without being given	
a colonoscopy	
you know, i	
try very hard to make our lunch hours	
educational and informative,	
but your insistence on	
talking about your own lives	
stymies me at	
every turn	
fine, sheldon, tell us about your giant rodents	
no, you squandered	
your time with me,	
and the moment	
has now passed	
feast on your disappointment,	
much as the capybara	
feasts on its own waste	
oh, bella, don't you see	
edward's only pushing you away	
because he loves you	
coming	
dr koothrappali	
i'm special agent page, fbi	
may i come in	
i'd like to talk to you	
about howard wolowitz	
oh, thank you	
all right	
well, how long	
have you known mr wolowitz	
rum cake	
no, thanks	
now, about mr	
wolowitz	
seven years	
i see	
i'm in this country	
legally, you know	
i'm sure you are	
now, to your knowledge, has mr	
wolowitz ever committed a crime	
of course not	
i'm here on an hb visa,	
which means i can't be	
associated in any way	
with crime	
or criminal activity	
and i'm not	
good	
to your knowledge,	
does mr wolowitz have any foreign contacts	
no, just me	
oh, there it is	
here comes a cavity search	
excuse me	
please don't send me back to india it's so crowded	
it's like the whole country	
is one endless comiccon,	
except everybody's wearing	
the same costume indian guy	
dr koothrappali, i'm not	
i love this country	
thethe baseball,	
the freedom,	
the rampant morbid obesity	
from california	
to the new york island	
i'm a real yankee doodle boy	
dr koothrappali, please	
♪ my country 'tis of thee ♪	
♪ liberty ♪	
♪ it's really great ♪	
so, when howard said the fbi	
would be contacting me,	
i was expecting mulder	
glad to see i got scully	
who	
mulder and scully	
xfiles	
"the truth is out there"	
never mind	
uh, so, what would you	
like to know	
you work with mr wolowitz here	
at the university, correct	
yes of course, we're in	
different departments	
he's an engineer and i'm	
an experimental physicist	
you know, one of those guys	
who examines the building blocks of creation	
and says,	
"hello, maker of the universe	
"i see what you did there	
good one"	
right	
now, how would you characterize	
your relationship with mr wolowitz	
good	
it's a good	
relationship	
of course, most of my	
relationships are good	
probably because	
i exude confidence	
people are drawn to that,	
you know	
confidence, not exuding	
do you know of any groups	
mr wolowitz is a member of	
you are beautiful,	
you know that	
you pop, sparkle	
and buzz electric	
i'm going to pick you up	
at , show you a night you will never forget	
sounds great	
really	
yeah	
can my sixfoottwo navy seal husband come with us	
is that	
oh, my, i didn't see the ring	
with my glasses off, so	
look at that,	
i'm starting to exude	
want to get that	
not particularly	
could you get that	
i suppose i could	
if i were asked	
would you please get that	
of course	
why do you have to make things	
so complicated	
dr cooper	
yes	
i'm special agent page, fbi	
you say you're special	
agent page, fbi	
here's my id	
and here is	
my justice league	
membership card	
but that doesn't	
prove i know batman	
i just want to ask you a few	
questions about howard wolowitz	
oh all right	
i doubt anyone	
would risk	
the stiff penalties for	
impersonating a federal officer	
just to ask questions about	
a minor league engineer	
with an unresolved	
oedipal complex	
thank you	
for the record,	
i truly support the fbi	
in the mission	
which is expressed	
through their motto	
fidelity, bravery, integrity	
correct, now to business	
years ago, i sent	
the fbi crime lab samples	
from a bag of excrement	
that had been lit on fire	
on my front porch	
for fingerprinting	
and dna analysis	
why haven't i heard back yet	
well, the fbi crime lab	
does have a lot on its plate	
that's of little comfort	
to a nation	
attempting to scrape	
burning feces off its shoes	
would you mind if we talked about mr wolowitz now	
a little, but go on	
thank you	
would you characterize him	
as responsible	
i'm going to answer that	
with a visual aid	
this is my ninedisc complete	
lord of the rings trilogy	
bluray set	
mr wolowitz borrowed it,	
damaged plastic retention	
hub number three	
and then returned it to me,	
hoping i wouldn't notice	
would you characterize that	
as responsible	
that's really not the sort of	
thing we're interested in	
you heard me say	
bluray, right	
i did	
very well	
would you be interested	
in knowing that mr wolowitz	
once snuck onto	
my world of warcraft account	
and changed the name	
of a certain level warlock	
from sheldor to smeldor	
i'm afraid not	
is there anything else	
"is there anything else"	
where would you like to start	
he refuses to pay fines	
when he's overdue	
with books i lend him	
he crashed the mars rover while	
attempting to impress a woman	
he recommended that i go see	
the third matrix movie	
because it was, and i quote,	
"just as good	
as the first one"	
if that's not irresponsible,	
i don't know what is	
the mars rover	
did i say mars rover	
you did	
that was actually	
a poorly chosen example,	
as it had nothing	
to do with me	
yes, well, let's talk about it anyway	
i don't want to	
not that my disinclination	
to discuss the topic	
should be interpreted as	
evidence of howard wolowitz's	
culpability in the destruction	
of government property	
worth millions of dollars	
thank you, dr cooper	
i think i have all i need	
oh, good	
i was afraid you were	
going to fixate	
on that mars rover incident	
hey, buddies	
guess who didn't get	
security clearance	
to work on	
the giant space laser	
what happened	
apparently, the background	
interviews didn't go well	
you guys wouldn't	
know anything	
about that, would you	
well, actually,	
i may have gotten	
a little tipsy	
when i talked to her	
and i may have	
hit on her a little bit	
i may have thrown up	
rum cake on her shoes	
i see	
well, it's good to know, when	
i need you guys, i can always count on you to step up and ruin everything	
i feel awful	
ah, me, too	
to tell you the truth,	
i thought if anyone was going to	
screw things up for howard,	
it'd be sheldon	
well, your expectations	
have been subverted	
aha	
what are you doing up	
sleep eludes me, leonard	
really	
maybe sleep has met you before	
mockery	
that's all you have to offer	
i'm sorry why can't you sleep	
who knows	
i haven't watched	
any scary movies recently	
i'm no longer obsessing	
over why the predicted mass	
of the quantum vacuum	
has little effect	
on the expansion	
of the universe	
and it's been weeks since i took	
that accidental sip of red bull	
did something happen today	
that's bothering you	
well, i did mention	
the mars rover incident	
to that fbi agent	
and probably cost howard	
his security clearance	
what	
but why should that keep me up	
because you feel guilty	
interesting	
so you're saying my insomnia is	
caused by a guilty conscience	
actually,	
you don't have insomnia	
you're sleeping now	
excuse me	
you're having a guiltridden dream	
do you have any evidence	
to support that hypothesis	
how about that gorn	
sitting on the couch	
that seems fairly conclusive	
no, gorn, no	
that's where i sit	
thank you for agreeing	
to see me, agent page	
thank you for filing a complaint	
with my superior, dr cooper	
i understand	
you want to recant	
your statement	
about howard wolowitz	
yes	
was your statement untrue	
no	
then i'm afraid	
you can't withdraw it	
i'm sorry i don't recall	
you saying "no backsies"	
is there anything else	
yes i'd like to offer	
a laudatory statement	
about howard's many excellent	
qualities that i believe	
will tip the scales	
back in his favor	
"howard joel wolowitz	
"h is for honesty,	
of which he has much	
"o's for outstanding,	
"which he is such	
"w's for witty,	
he's quick with a joke	
a's for artistic, his ability	
" i'm sorry	
dr cooper, this matter	
is already closed	
but i still have	
"rd joel wolowitz" left to go	
it's closed	
i don't understand	
why you people	
are picking on my	
friend, howard,	
when there are much more serious	
security threats to pursue	
for instance,	
when i first met leonard,	
he was on the verge	
of giving away	
rocket secrets	
to a north korean spy,	
and not one agent	
ever investigated that	
this is leonard hofstadter	
no, it's a different leonard	
he's	
chinese, red hair, six fingers	
goodbye	
raj	
have you seen howard	
i think he's eating lunch	
uh, sheldon, i want you	
to meet neil degrasse tyson	
from the hayden planetarium	
in new york	
i'm quite familiar	
with dr tyson	
he's responsible	
for the demotion of pluto	
from planetary status	
i liked pluto	
ergo i do not like you	
but i actually	
didn't demote pluto	
that was a vote	
of the international	
astronomical union	
if "ifs" and "buts"	
were candy and nuts,	
we'd all have a merry christmas	
think about that, dr tyson	
is that the guy you	
were telling me about	
oh, yeah	
howard	
the person at fault for you	
not getting	
a security clearance is me	
you	
yes, but before you get upset,	
i want you to know	
i went to the fbi	
and retracted my statement	
and they were okay with that	
no if anything,	
i made it worse	
in any case, i have	
been riddled with guilt,	
which is causing	
gorninfested rem sleep	
so, i'm here now	
to say i'm sorry	
are you kidding me	
you've set my career back	
at least two years,	
and you think you can make it	
right with "i'm sorry"	
yes	
i followed the social protocol	
i attempted to right the wrong,	
and when i failed to do so,	
i delivered a heartfelt apology	
now you say,	
"apology accepted,"	
and i will offer you	
a onetimeonly high five	
your apology is not accepted	
you're tricking me	
it really is, isn't it	
leave me alone, sheldon	
dr cooper, i just	
wanted you to know	
i'm sorry for the role i	
played in the pluto matter	
oh, shut up	
sheldon	
hello	
what are you doing here	
i have troubles, penny	
i've come to pour them out	
to the sympathetic ear	
of the local barkeep	
you know, they have	
a really nice bar	
over at the olive garden	
i don't like the olive garden	
they treat me like family	
okay, sheldon	
what can i get you	
alcohol	
could you be a little more specific	
ethyl alcohol	
milliliters	
i'm sorry, honey	
i don't know milliliters	
ah blame president james	
"jimmy" carter	
he started america on a path	
to the metric system	
but then just gave up	
he wonders why he	
was a oneterm president	
would you say that's	
about  milliliters	
more or less	
great	
now, where were we	
i believe you were about	
to ask me to choose a cocktail	
fortunately, thanks	
to computersavvy alcoholics,	
there's an app for that	
let's see	
harvey wallbanger eh	
sex on the beach	
i hardly think so	
rob roy,	
silk slipper, mad hatter	
ooh	
i'll have a rosewater ricky	
a what	
you'll need pitted,	
brandied cherries, gin,	
rosewater,	
angostura bitters	
and overproofed rum	
now, first, dust the cherries with sugar, then spray them with a mixture	
of rum and bitters	
then ignite the rum, caramel	
here you go one	
rosewater ricky	
that's not how it looks	
in the picture	
oh, yeah, you know, every	
bartender makes it differently	
why don't you give it a try	
all right	
to the metric system	
i can't taste the cherries	
all right	
sheldon, what's on your mind	
i wronged howard,	
and he won't accept my apology	
oh, right, that	
yes, leonard told me	
sorry, honey	
penny, you face failure	
on a daily basis	
how do you cope	
i drink	
to drinking	
nope	
oh, if only there were some way	
to force howard	
to accept my apology	
so i could escape	
this miasma of guilt	
you know, sometimes	
stuff just happens,	
and there's nothing	
you can do about it	
for example, lisa peterson	
hasn't talked to me	
since the th grade,	
because no matter how	
much you apologize,	
you can't go back and	
undryhump someone's boyfriend	
i see	
you're saying i'm facing	
starfleet academy's	
unwinnable command scenario	
the kobayashi maru	
exactly	
sometimes you can't win	
captain kirk won	
kirk cheated	
impressive that you know that	
it's hard to believe	
i'm actually having	
this conversation with you	
right there with you	
kirk beat the kobayashi maru	
by reprogramming the simulator	
that's it	
what	
i'll reprogram howard	
what	
sheldon, you can't	
reprogram people	
no, you can't reprogram people	
to james tiberius kirk	
hello, all	
leonard hello	
koothrappali hey	
howard, you're feeling better	
about me today, aren't you	
not really	
yes, you are	
i'm using	
neurolinguistic programming	
to modify your thought patterns	
oh	
go away, sheldon	
there's a $ ebook	
down the drain	
what's in the bag	
it's for howard	
oh sheldon, you can't fix this with gifts	
nevertheless, i've hurt you,	
and whether you	
forgive me or not,	
i want you to	
have this	
you're giving me	
a couch cushion	
no	
the cushion is merely symbolic	
i'm giving you my spot	
on the couch	
but you love that spot	
no i love my mother	
my feelings for my spot	
are much greater	
it is the singular location	
in space	
around which revolves	
my entire universe	
and now it's yours	
oh, my god, dude	
now you have to forgive him	
all right	
apology accepted	
high five	
not too hard	
thank you	
i haven't cried like this	
since toy story	
i got to tell you,	
sheldon, i understand why	
you chose this spot	
i mean, the temperature is	
good, but there's no draft	
i can see the television,	
but i can still talk to	
i changed my mind	
get out of my spot	
how long	
seconds
