and now the	
kung pao chicken	
ah, yeah	
wow	
smooth	
and finally,	
my moo shu pork	
whoohoo	
wolowitz	
oh, there you have it, gentlemen	
our entire dinner unpacked by robot	
and it only took  minutes	
impressive,	
but we must be cautious	
why	
today, it's a chinese food retrieval robot	
tomorrow,	
it travels back in time	
and tries to kill sarah connor	
i don't think that's	
going to happen, sheldon	
no one ever does	
that's why it happens	
hey is the food here	
ooh what's that	
that, dear lady,	
is the wolowitz	
programmable hand,	
designed for extravehicular repairs on the international space station	
ah, cool	
ask me to pass the soy sauce	
oh, does that come up much	
on the space station	
mostly with asian and jewish astronauts	
all right pass the soy sauce	
coming up	
so how's work	
oh, it's not bad	
kind of hungry	
yeah, we all are	
just wait	
you realize, penny, that the technology	
that went into this arm	will one day make unskilled food servers	
such as yourself obsolete	
really	
they're going to make a robot	
that spits on your hamburger	
i thought you broke up with her	
why is she here	
okay, here we go	
passing the soy sauce	
put out your hand	
oh	
that's amazing	
i wouldn't say amazing	
at best,	
it's a modest leap forward rom the basic technology	
that gave us	
country bear jamboree	
hey, sheldon	
yes	
peace	
no, not peace	
hang on	
does nasa know you're using	
that thing as a napkin holder	
you kidding they still think	
it's in a secure locker at jpl	
you stole it	
borrowed	
the trick is to carry it out to your car like you own it	
excuse me	
oh	
amy's at the dry cleaners,	
and she's made a very	
amusing pun	
"i don't care for perchloroethylene,	
and i don't like glycol ether"	
get it	
she doesn't like glycol ether	
sounds like "either"	
"lol"	
who's amy	
his girlfriend	
sheldon has a girlfriend	
she's not my girlfriend	
how long	
has this been going on	
four months	
she's not my girlfriend	
are you telling me, for	
the past four months	
i have been asking you,	
"what's new"	
and you never thought to go with,	
"sheldon has a girlfriend"	
she's not my girlfriend	
ah dddd	
how did they meet	
raj and i entered sheldon's	
information on a dating site,	
and it spit out	
amy farrah fowler	
oh, my god	
sheldon and amy	
or, as we	
call them, "shamy"	
shamy	
i am so digging the shamy	
all right,	
everyone pay attention	
yes, i have a friend named amy farrah fowler	
yes, she is female	
yes, we communicate	
on a daily basis,	
but no, she is not my girlfriend	
okay, well, what do	
you communicate about	
well, my work in physics,	
her work in neurobiology,	
and most recently,	
the possibility of our having a child together	
thank you	
wait a minute	
a child you never see this girl	
you just email	
and text and twitter	
now you're considering having a baby	
amy pointed out	
that between the two of us,	
our genetic material has the potential of producing the first in a line of intellectually superior,	
benign overlords to guide humanity to a brighter tomorrow	
i'm guessing	
that future historians will condemn us	
for not taking this opportunity	
to kill sheldon	
okay, i have a question	
yes, penny	
you don't even like people touching you	
how are you going to have sex	
why on earth would we have sex	
oh, honey, did your mom	
not have the talk with you	
you know, when your private parts started growing	
i'm quite aware of the way	
humans usually reproduce,	
which is messy,	
unsanitary,	
and based on living next	
to you for three years,	
involves loud and unnecessary	
appeals to a deity	
oh, god	
yes, exactly	
consequently,	
if amy and i choose to bring new life into this world,	
it will be accomplished	
clinically,	
with fertility experts in a lab	
with petri dishes	
which reminds me	
you have broad hips	
and a certain cornfed vigor	
is your womb available for rental	
still digging the shamy	
look, sheldon,	
before you race off to	
the fertility clinic,	
you might want to think about	
uh, gee, i don't know	
maybe actually spending	some time with her	
you mean dating	
yeah	
i can't date amy	
why not	
she's not my girlfriend	
okay, look, don't think of it as dating a girlfriend	
think of it as, uh getting to know the future mother of your child	
oh	
i hadn't considered that	
i suppose she will have	to have access to our progeny	
and you don't think	
i can achieve the required intimacy via text messaging	
probably not	
huh	
it would appear as if the phone companies	
have been lying to me	
penny	
penny penny	
you do realize i stand	
on the other side of the door	
waiting for you to finish	
knocking three times	
i know i can see the shadow of your feet under the door	
yeah, my point is	
it's a waste of time	
if you're looking for an example of a waste of time,	
i would refer you to the conversation	
we're having right now	
what do you want	
i've decided to take your advice	
and have arranged to go on a date with amy farrah fowler	
oh, that's great	
have fun	
wait	
you have to drive me	
what	
you know i don't drive	
well, go ask leonard	
i did	
he said and i quote	
"ask penny	
it was her cockamamy idea"	
leonard said "cockamamy"	
actually, i'm paraphrasing having been raised in a christian household,	
i'm uncomfortable with the language he used	
and to be honest,	
i'm not entirely comfortable with "cockamamy"	
okay, fine when's the date	
now	
now	
hurry we're going to be late	
sheldon,	
did it ever occur to you	
that i might have other plans	
i'm sorry	
do you have other plans	
well, no, not per se, but	
so this conversation is as pointless	
as your doorknocking soliloquy	
let me get my cockamamy keys	
wolowitz	
oh, god, that feels so good	
yeah, that's the spot	
oh, baby	
mrs wolowitz	
howard, dinner's ready	
i'll eat later	
i'm busy	
oh, yeah	
just like a real hand	
hmm	
thank you for driving me	
you're welcome	
i wish you weren't wearing flipflops	
it's dangerous to drive in flipflops	
sheldon	
sorry	
i just don't want to be	
yet another flipflop fatality	
can i ask you a question	
given your community college education,	
i encourage you to ask me	
as many as possible	
yeah	
well, my question is	
and i'm pretty sure	
i know the answer	
is this your first date	
that depends	
does squaredancing with my sister at a teens for jesus fourth of july hoedown count as a date	
no	
then, this is my first date	
okay well, then,	
there's a couple of things	
you should probably know	
i have a master's degree	
and two doctorates	
the things i should know,	
i do know	
my point is, i know more	
about dating than you,	
and if you were as smart	
as you think you are,	
you would listen to me	
if you know so much,	
how come i have a date tonight	
and you have nothing better to do than drive me to it	
fair point	
you know,	
there's something	
i've always wondered about aquaman	
yeah	
where does he poop	
what	
what would a toilet	
look like in atlantis	
how would you flush it	
and when you did flush it,	
where would the poop go	
hold that thought	
hey, howard	
what's going on	
what	
hold on	
howard, howard, slow down	
the robot hand	
is stuck on your what	
you're not going to believe this	
so, um, amy,	
sheldon tells me	
you're a neuro somethingorother	
neurobiologist	
your "check engine" light is on	
yeah, it's okay	
but the light indicates	
don't bother	
i've wasted many an hour tilting at that particular windmill	
uh, what is that	
scent you're wearing	
it smells great	
dandruff shampoo	
i have dry scalp	
ah	
well, your hair	looks very nice	
are you a homosexual	
no, no, i'm just giving	
you a compliment	
hmm	
would have been more flattered	
if you were a homosexual	
guys, how 'bout	
some music	
oh, no, i wouldn't care for that	
amy	
no, thank you	
okay	
uncomfortable	
silence it is	
hey, sheldon, have you told amy	
what it was like for you growing up in texas	
no	
well, why don't	you tell her	
all right	
it was hell	
any follow up, amy	
no	
i myself grew up in nebraska	
small town outside of omaha	
nice place, mostly family farms,	
a few meth labs	
i'm sorry, how is this better than uncomfortable silence	
i don't know	
i was just trying something	
muggles	
you slipped and fell into a robot hand	
yes	
penis first	
yes now, help me	
i'd suggest a lubricant,	
but i have a feeling	
you fell on some of that as well	
not funny, leonard	
really a robot hand's got a death grip on your junk, dude	
that's funny, ask anyone	
plea before my mother	
walks in, get this off me	
okay, let's see	
no, no	
don't touch	
the program is paused	
well, then let's	
unpause it	
no, no i loaded	
the wrong program	
the hand thinks it's holding a screwdriver in outer space	
if you continue the program,	
it's gonna start twisting	
aall right	
um, how about this	
when winnie the pooh got his head stuck in the honey tree,	
his friends all grabbed onto him	
and pulled and pulled	
you do what you want,	
i'm not touching another man's honey tree	
all right, uh,	
forget pulling	
how about we get an electric saw and cut it off	
what	
no saws	
one circumcision was enough	
how about an acetylene torch	
okay, i can't believe	
this needs to be said out loud	
no pulling, no saws, no torches	
well, then what do	
you want us to do	
mrs wolowitz	
howard, i made cookies for you	
and your little friends	
that's great, mom, thanks	
i'll bring them up with some hawaiian punch	
don't come up here	
why not are you	ashamed of your mother	
yes, but that's not the point	
get me out of here	
you have any ideas, raj	
right now, all i can think about	
is cookies and hawaiian punch	
hey, here's another possible	
topic of conversation	
this is a big night for sheldon	
right, sheldon	
big night	
the winter solstice is a big night	
it's over  hours	
in southern california	
that's an amusing factoid	
thank you	
no, no	
my point is, uh, tonight is	
sheldon's first official date	
discuss	
is this true	
apparently, a semiincestuous teens for jesus fourth of july hoedown didn't count	
so, um, amy, what about you	
do you date much	
once a year	
it's a deal i made	
with my mother in exchange for her silence on the matter,	
as well as the occasional use of her george foreman grill	
that seals in the flavor without the fat	
how about you, penny	
do you go on many dates	
uh, yeah, i wouldn't say many	
a few	
what's your characterization of	approximately  different men as "a few"	
what	
where did you get  men	
simple extrapolation	
in the three years	
that i've known you,	
you were single for two	
during that time,	
i saw  different suitors	
if we work backwards,	
correcting for observation bias	
and postulate an initial dating age of	
whoa, wait,	
wait, wait	
i did not start dating at	
i'm sorry sixteen	
fourteen	
my mistake	
now, assuming the left side of a bell curve	
peaking around the present,	
that would bring the total	
up to  men	
plus or minus eight men	
remarkable	
did you have sexual intercourse	with all of these men	
no	
although that number would be fairly easy to calculate	
oh	
based on the number of awkward encounters i've had with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning,	
plus the number of times	
she's returned home wearing the same clothes she wore the night before	
okay, sheldon, i think	
you've made your point	
so we multiply	minus  men	
before the loss of virginity	
so	
times  gives us	sexual partners	
let's round that up to	
okay, sheldon, you are so wrong	
that is not even close to the real number	
i'm gonna need a drink over here	
this is very interesting	
cultural perceptions are subjective	
penny, to your mind,	
are you a slut	
no no	
no	
let's just all finish our dinners, okay	
this is	an interesting topic	
how many sexual encounters have you had	
does volunteering for a scientific experiment in which orgasm was achieved by electronically stimulating the pleasure centers of the brain count	
i should think so	
then	
okay, come on	
almost there	
don't tug	
no tugging	
next time, take your own advice	
excuse me,	
could you help us out	
my, my, my	
what do we have here	
i slipped and fell	
yeah, we get that a lot	
what is this	
it's a robot arm	
where's the rest of the robot	
i only built the arm	
'cause that's all	
you needed, right	
can you please just help me	
all right, all right	
hang on, stay calm	
i need an orderly with a wheelchair	
i got a robot hand grasping	
a man's penis out here	
you think you could be a little more discreet	
i'm sorry,	
we don't have a code for	
"robot hand	
grasping a man's penis"	
why is it hooked up to a computer	
uh, it's what controls the arm	
but it's frozen	
did you try turning it off	
and back on again	
no, you see, it's more complicated than that	
no, wait	
winnie the pooh is out of the honey tree	
now can we have cookies	and hawaiian punch	
you were right	
this was a very	productive evening	
i saw a whole new side of	
amy farrah fowler tonight	
i did not have sex with  guys	
i'll be happy to check the math,	
but numbers	
don't lie, penny	
in any event,	
now that amy and i have	spent quality time together,	
i feel much more confident proceeding to the next stage of our relationship	
and that is	
using in vitro fertilization	
and a surrogate uterus to gift humanity with our progeny	
you're still	
on that	
in these uncertain times,	
doesn't humanity deserve a gift	
okay, you know what	
i'm gonna come at this	
in a whole new way	
sheldon, if you try to make	
a baby with amy in a petri dish,	
i'm gonna tell	
your mother on you	
that's no threat	
my mother's always wanted a grandchild	
really your deeply religious bornagain christian mother	wants a testtube grandbaby born out of wedlock	
curses	
if i'd thought of that	
in the first place,	
i could've saved myself	
this whole night	
well, it's not that late	
you could still go out	
and look for number	
good night	
hey, howard,	
what's up	
i've decided	
not to procreate	
yeah, yeah, great	
howard, uh, slow down	
what do you mean it happened again
