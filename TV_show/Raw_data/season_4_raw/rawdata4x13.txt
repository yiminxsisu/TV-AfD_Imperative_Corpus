hey so you guys ready	
to order	
since we come in	
every tuesday night at	
and order the same exact thing,	
and it's now ,	
i believe your question	
not only answers itself	
but also stands alongside	
such other nonsensical queries	
as "who let the dogs out"	
and, uh, "how are they hanging""	
okay	
so, the usual, with extra spit	
on sheldon's hamburger	
penny, a moment	
do you have plans	
this weekend	
oh, gee, amy, i'm sorry,	
i'm actually pretty busy	
this weekend	
probably serving food	
that was ordered today	
that's too bad i was hoping	
you could be my plusone	
at the institute	
of interdisciplinary studies'	
symposium on the impact	
of current scientific research	
on societal interactions	
the what	
it's an annual	
science conference	
we've all been invited to speak	
oh oh, okay, well, you know,	
like i said, i have plans, so shame since you're my best friend,	
i thought it would be	
a good bonding opportunity	
i'm your best friend	
don't you read my blog	
oh, don't feel bad	
i never read leonard's, and	
i used to sleep with him	
do you know anybody else	
who would appreciate	
an allexpensepaid spa weekend	
at a fourstar resort	
in big sur	
no, i really i'm sorry,	
free what sorry, what, what	
i think her weekend just opened up	
wait, wait, just to be clear,	
when you guys say "spa,"	
does that mean the same thing	
as when regular people say it	
pretty much	
except we keep	
our shirts on in the sauna	
you know, it is going	
to be difficult,	
but i'm going to cancel my plans	
so i can do this for my bestie	
please don't touch my breasts	
i i wasn't going to	
all right i just want	
to establish boundaries	
boy, this is great i haven't had a vacation in ages	
in order to take a vacation,	
one first has to work	
you know, for a smart guy,	
you really seem to have a	
hard time grasping the concept	
"don't piss off the people who handle the things you eat"	
that does seem to be	
a valid principle	
i trust penny will adhere to	
the "official california	
restaurant workers'	
solemn oath of ethics	
and cleanliness"	
i don't believe	
there's any such thing	
you lied to me	
good morning	
if i could have everyone's	
attention, please	
i know we're all eager	
to get on the road to big sur,	
so if we focus, i'm sure we can	
get through this orientation	
in under a half an hour	
then it's just q&a, quiz, safety drills,	
pose for commemorative	
group photo and we're off	
don't worry	
just sit next to me during the quiz,	
and you can copy my answers	
sheldon	
raj	
what are you doing	
i don't think so	
you've had your allotted	
six ounces	
the first bathroom break	
isn't until the denny's	
located near bakersfield,	
which is approximately	
two and half hours away	
remember, people, we're only as	strong as our weakest bladder	
nobody cares about	
your kegel exercises	
all right we have	
seven people, and two cars	
in the lead car,	
driven by leonard,	
will be myself,	
amy farrah fowler,	
and penny	
yes	
he had you in the other car,	
but i got you upgraded	
yay	
she made the case	
that if we break down	
in the middle of nowhere,	
your nebraska backwoods skills	
and brawny hands	
will give us the best chance	
to survive in the wild	
brawny	
they're bigger	
than mine	
red leader to red five,	come in	
red leader to red five,	come in	
howard, you promised	
wolowitz	
fine red five to red leader	
what do you want now	
it's  i'm requesting your quarterhourly location update	
still right behind you	
copy that, red five	
radio contact is sufficient	
no need to extend your middle finger	
so, amy, i've	
been wondering,	
are you and sheldon going	
to be sharing a room	
no, we discussed it	
we decided we didn't want	
to jeopardize our relationship	
by getting to know	
each other too well	
indeed nothing sours	
a friendship more	
than overfamiliarity	
with someone's toilet routine	
i can vouch for that	
hey	
not you, him	
oh thanks	
although yours	
was an eyeopener	
don't worry, penny	
you're my plusone	
you'll bunk with me	
and fyi, travel	
makes me constipated,	
so i'm the ideal	
hotel roommate	
terrific	
are we there yet	
i hope we get there in time	
to see the keynote address	
really you want to see	
the keynote	
yeah, it sounds fun	
"super bacteria	
global apocalypse or	
exciting research opportunity"	
actually, i was thinking we could go straight to the room and take a nap	
really	
and miss the keynote	
we can watch it later on cspan	
besides, i was really	
looking forward to you and me	
napping together in the hotel	
honey, if you're	
that tired,	
why don't you just take a nap here in the car	
no, see, it's not	
hang on	
it's leonard	
hi, leonard	
leonard	
yeah, hi listen, i just	
got a text from raj	
he wanted me to tell you	
that when howard says "nap,"	
he means "sex"	
thank you, raj	
are you an element	
in the actinoid series	
no	
amy	
are you usually radioactive	
when found in nature	
no	
are you in the	
lanthanoid series	
amy, it's penny's turn	
penny	
uh, i don't know	
are you food	
that's not apropos	
we've already established	
i'm found in the periodic table	
well, it's a table, right	
i mean, why can't there	
be food on it	
i knew she wasn't	
lead car materiel	
who elected you	
road trip god	
leonard	
it was a latenight vote	
we were all exhausted,	
and he was threatening	
to filibuster	
it's not technically	
"road trip god""	
it's travel supervisor	
although road trip god	
does have a certain ring to it	
i don't understand	
why you people	
just let him bully	
you like this	
someone should	
stand up to him	
what's he going to do	
i can't believe you let him	
kick me out of the car	
what could we do	
he's the travel supervisor	
don't worry, penny	
this is a better car anyway	
yeah it's the love car	
should i ask	
� they say we're young	
and we don't know �	
� we won't find out	
until we grow �	
� well, i don't know	
if all that's true �	
� 'cause you got me,	
and, baby, i got you �	
� babe �	
� mm dada,	
dada, dada �	
both	
� i got you, babe �	
red leader, i'm really sorry	
both	
� i got you, babe �	
wolowitz and bernadette	
� i got you, babe �	
i missed you	
you know what	
i missed you, too	
bernadette	
oh, my god, glenn	
great to see you	
are you here	
for the conference	
yeah, i'm doing	
a global warming panel	
oh, good for you	
uh, glenn,	
this is my boyfriend howard	
nice to meet you	
hi	
ow hi	
you're a lucky man	
bernie's	
a great gal	
yes "bernie" sure is	
well, i got to run	
the panel's tomorrow morning	
it's called, "remembering snow	
a look back"	
i'll try to catch it	
oh, great	
bye	
bye	
hey bernie	
yeah	
please tell me he's your gay cousin	
no	
he was one of my professors	
in college	
oh that's a relief	
then we went out	
for a year	
come on, let's check in,	
so we can take that nap	
no, it's not necessarily	
proportional	
shut up	
that green bag	
is dr cooper's	
here's an extra five	
make him wait	
oh	
right to the nap, huh okay	
uh, so, this glenn guy	
you say you went out with	
him for, like, a year	
do we really need to talk about my old boyfriend now	
no i guess not	
what is he, like,	
sixfour, sixfive	
sixseven	
probably has a hard time	
finding a suit that fits	
is something	
bothering you	
no it's just	
what	
i'm just thinking	
if you had sex with that guy,	
i mean, there's nothing	
i can do here	
that will make	
any kind of impact	
howard, it's not a contest	
i love you	
i want to be with you	
yeah, great, love you, too,	
but	
if it were a contest,	
i wouldn't have a chance, right	
you can't think that way	
yep	
loser	
howard, stop it	
sorry i just	
never figured that	
a guy like me going out	
with a girl like you	
would ever have to compete	
with a guy like that	
wait a minute, "a girl like me"	
what's that mean	
i'm i	
are you saying you	
don't think i'm hot enough	
to go out with a guy like glenn	
no no, i'm saying	
exactly the opposite	
i'm too hot to go out	
with a guy like glenn	
yeah, let's go with that	
still nothing	
remind me to try again in an hour	
will do	
so	
girl talk	
um, sure	
what do you got in mind	
do you subscribe to the freudian	
theory of penis envy	
um, i never really	
thought about it	
why	
sometimes i think it might be	
nice to have one	
really	
not for sex, for convenience	
you can't deny that,	
by comparison,	
our internal plumbing	
is extremely high maintenance	
again, i've never given	
it much thought	
we have time now	
think about it	
oh, good	
hey	
can i stay here tonight	
yeah why, what happened	
howard's a complete	
and total ass	
oh, yeah, that	
come on in	
thanks i'll sleep	
on the floor	
not necessary	
penny and i are perfectly	
comfortable sharing a bed	
we are	
of course, we're best friends	
oh, right, right, the blog	
word of warning, though	
i'm prone to night terrors,	
so when i wake up kicking	
and screaming,	
don't panic	
just pin me down and stroke my hair, and i'll be fine	
hey, can i stay here tonight	
shhshhshh	
sheldon's asleep	
what's going on	
well, howard's a complete	
and total ass,	
bernadette's in my bed,	
and no matter how much you	
stroke amy's hair, she bites	
what	
never mind	
can i stay here or not	
uh, sure	
all right	
so, how do you want	
to do this	
well, i'm not getting	
in bed with him	
yeah, it is	
a little like	
getting into	
dracula's coffin	
we're just gonna have to make the best of this	
okay, when you say	
"make the best of it"	
sleep	
right	
so we'll just call the middle here the neutral zone	
the what	
star trek	
you know, the	
neutral zone	
between the federation	
and the romulan empire	
oh, okay	
just like old times	
of course,	
sometimes the federation	
and the romulans	
would enter	
the neutral zone	
to negotiate a	
temporary truce	
sweetie, let me	
put this in a way	
you'll understand	
from the waist down, my shields are up	
got it, got it	
we can do all kinds of stuff from the waist up,	you know	
go to sleep	
good night	
please tell me you're not having coitus	
we are not having coitus	
can you guarantee	
that it won't happen	
at any time during the night	
yes	
no	
announcer	
next on turner classic movies,	
bridget jones's diary	
oh, my god, i'm crying already	
sheldon	
raj raj	
raj	
i need to sleep here tonight	
why	
howard is a complete	
and total ass,	
bernadette is in penny's	
bed, amy bites,	
and penny may or may not	
have coitus with leonard	
okay come on in	
leonard, are you asleep	
no	
i really appreciate you letting	
me stay here tonight	
sure, no problem	
i know it's kinda weird	
true dat	
"true dat"	
i've gotten a lot more street	
since we broke up	
right	
still mad at me about that	
no no, i understand	
i got too intense,	
you had to back off	
thank you	
i've gotten a lot better	
at that, you know	
i've dated four different women	
since we broke up	
and i didn't tell any of them	
that i loved them	
and wanted	
to have their babies	
good for you	
okay, good night	
good night	
you know, maybe it wouldn't be	
the worst idea in the world	
to violate the neutral zone	
for just one night	
oh	
hey, leonard,	
sheldon kicked me	
out of the room,	
gave me your key	
penny's here	
no, we don't want to watch	
bridget jones's diary	
good morning and welcome	
to science and society	
i'm dr sheldon cooper, bs, ms,	
ma, phd, and scd	
omg, right	
perhaps that joke was a little	
too hippiedippy for this crowd	
all right then, we'll begin	
with opening remarks	
miss rostenkowski, would you like to start us off by discussing	your assessment of science's responsibility to society	
sure	
i think all branches	
of science	
have to move cautiously	
these days	
it's not just giant	
nuclear weapons	
that can destroy	
the world	
as a microbiologist,	
i can tell you	
even the tiniest organisms	
can still tear you a new one	
interesting	
i think what you might need	
to know about my colleague	
is that though she claims	
her field of interest	
is tiny organisms,	
she certainly has spent	
her fair share of time	
around what we can assume was	
pretty massive weaponry	
i think mr wolowitz	
needs to keep in mind	
that the past	
is the past	
but he should know	
that i am the kind of girl	
who could get all	
the giant missiles she wants	
are we talking about women	
wanting penises	
because i'd like to weigh in	
dr koothrappali, would you care to join the conversation	
certainly	
i'd like to raise two points	
number one, i think they are	
talking about penises	
and number two, these mimosas	
are kicking my little brown ass	
i'd like to kick	
your little brown ass	
what did i do	
oh, i don't know	
maybe when you walk	
into a hotel room	
and you see a guy getting back	
together with his girlfriend,	
you should consider doing	
something other	
than crawling into	
the adjoining bed	
i did you said no	
bridget jones	
penny	
we weren't getting	
back together	
it was a onetime thing	
excuse me	
we're not taking comments or questions from the audience just yet	
oh, shut up, sheldon	
hi, bestie	
all right,	
why don't we see if we can bring this back to topic	
let me ask you	
something, bernie	
i guess not	
how would you feel if	
you met my exgirlfriend	
and she was like	
angelina jolie	
oh, come on, howard,	
be realistic	
what, i'm not hot enough	
for angelina jolie	
i'd like to weigh in here	
no	
all right,	
why don't we open it up to q&a from the audience	
penny	
yeah, i have a question	
is there anybody who can get me	
the hell out of here	
and back to los angeles	
tonight	
glenn	
i'm driving back	
to la tonight	
penny, that's glenn	
glenn, that's penny	
no	
sheldon	
red leader to red five	
red leader	
to red five	
anybody up for a little game	
i spy with my little eye	
a nonferrous metal	
must be out of range	
leonard, can i ask you	
a question	
sure	
are you bothered by the fact	
that your former girlfriend	
left the symposium	
with what is probably	
the most beautiful man	
i've ever seen in my life	
no why do you ask	
because we're going	
miles per hour	
all right, if no one's going	
to guess	
i was spying the aluminum rims	
on the police car	
we passed a few miles back
