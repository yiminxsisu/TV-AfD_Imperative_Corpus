ma, ma, calm down	
listen to me	
i know it says click	
with the mouse,	
but on a laptop,	
the trackpad is the mouse	
now, put your finger on it	
doesn't matter which finger	
good choice	
now move it down to your email icon	
yeah, the little envelope	
what do you mean,	
"what does it look like "	
it looks like an envelope	
fine, you don't like	
the computer,	
don't use it	
sure, we can exchange it	
for a salad spinner goodbye	
that's a hanukkah present	
you're regretting, hmm	
i won't say that	
all senior citizens	
who can't master technology	
should be publicly flogged,	
but if we made an	
example of one or two,	
it might give the others	
incentive to try harder	
i had a great idea	
you know how	
we're always having	
to stop and solve	
differential equations,	
like when you're doing	
fourier analysis,	
or using the	
schrodinger equation	
howard doesn't	
he's only an engineer	
i was thinking,	
we could write a little app	
that would use	
handwriting recognition,	
and then run it through a	
symbolic evaluation engine	
you just use your smartphone, take a picture of the equation and bam	
you know what's a great app	
the one that makes fart noises	
you know, leonard,	
that's actually	
a valid idea	
very good	
can you say that and not	
make it sound like i'm a cat	
who learned	
how to use the toilet	
no	
the two achievements	
are equally surprising	
and equally admirable,	
though if pressed,	
i'd have to give	
a slight edge to the cat	
i'll save you the pain	
and nervousness	
of waiting for the answer	
i agree to be part of	
your project congratulations	
oh, yay for me	
what about you guys	
i can't promise anything,	
but people do make money	
off stuff like this	
a few extra bucks	
would be nice	
i could finally move out	
of my mother's house	
where would you go	
i always dreamed about building	
a little place of my own	
over the garage	
you know, if i made more money,	
i could take time off from work	
and give pretty girls	
submarine rides	
what's that	
some weird sex thing	
no	
you take pretty girls underwater	
in your private submarine,	
and you show them fish	
why does everything	
have to be dirty with you	
i was thinking we could work	
on this at night,	
and then maybe	
in a couple of weeks,	
we'll have ourselves an app	
to sell	
sounds like	
we're in business	
i think we should take a picture to capture this moment	
yeah	
oh	
was that the best  cents	
i ever spent, or what	
i checked the	
app store	
no one is doing	
handwritingrecognition	
differential equation solving	
oh, dear lord, shush	
what	
you have so few good ideas,	
leonard	
and you're just going	
to spill the beans	
in front of an outsider	
who, me	
sheldon, i don't think	
penny cares	
about handwritingrecognition	
based differential	
the stars at night	
are big and bright 	
deep in the heart	
of texas 	
she's not going	
to steal our idea	
what idea	
we're gonna write an application	
the prairie sky	
is wide and high 	
deep in the heart 	
okay, stop, stop	
of texas 	
whatever your secret is,	
i'm sure it's boring,	
so i'm not interested	
it's not boring at all	
you see,	
in higher order mathematics,	
there are certain sets	
of equations that	
bored	
satisfied	
hardly	
consider this unlikely	
but very plausible scenario	
a young woman alone	
in the big city	
her ridiculous dream	
of becoming an actress	
lies shattered about her	
hey, wait a minute	
well, hang on	
let's see where he's going	
then it hits her	
how is she going to survive	
i mean, she has no prospects,	
no marketable skills	
and then one day,	
she meets a group of geniuses	
and their friend howard	
hey, i	
hang on	
let's see where he's going	
she befriends them,	
and then lies in wait	
until they reveal	
a marketable idea,	
which she steals	
and sells to the highest bidder	
that is ridiculous	
oh, is it	
let's see you come up with an explanation as to why this woman hangs out with us all the time	
oh, great you know what	
i've already mooched	
dinner off you guys	
i don't need to listen to this	
there's your answer,	
free food	
all right,	
i've taken the liberty	
of drafting	
these workflow charts	
which outline our various duties	
and the path we will follow	
as we develop	
our groundbreaking new app	
hey, why am i in charge	
of phone support	
seems a bit racist	
a customer service	
representative	
with an indian accent	
will create the impression	
we're a vast enterprise that	
uses overseas call centers	
oh	
very clever	
but still racist	
duly noted, steve	
from wichita	
why am i listed as your	
executive assistant	
because the word "secretary"	
has fallen into disrepute	
fyi, my mother's	
birthday is coming up	
i'm going to need you to pick up a present	
okay, we need to stop for a minute	
leonard, please, we can talk during our break	
we have one coming up	
at midnight	
we'll need snacks	
sheldon, you're not in charge	
it's my idea	
i'm in charge	
oh, of course you are	
look at the organizational chart	
you're clearly listed	
as founder	
well, yes, and you're listed	
as chief executive officer,	
chief financial officer	
and chief operating officer	
you missed	
chief science officer,	
chairman of the board, and head	
of the secret santa committee	
okay	
you need to get clear on this right now	
i am in charge of this project	
ooh leonard's going all	
alpha nerd on sheldon's ass	
all right all right,	
i'm not going to argue with you	
sheldon cooper is nothing	
if not a team player	
dr hofstadter, you have the conn	
thank you	
i thought we might start	
by talking	
about the user interface	
oh, dear lord, we're doomed	
so this button here	
will allow you	
to scan a new equation,	
but over here,	
you can press this,	
and just substitute new values	
for the coefficients	
good one, boss	
what	
this diagram	
i assume	
you were opening with a joke	
it certainly buoyed up	
this employee's esprit de corps	
it's not a joke	
it's the real design	
in that case, may i offer 27 little tweaks to make it slightly less embarrassing	
sheldon, i think	
this will work	
let's just try it my way	
oh, i'mi'm sorry	
i assumed that you wanted	
candid truthtelling	
from your employees,	
but i realize now,	
you want the mindless nattering	
of complacent	
yesmen	
are you done	
if you say so, boss	
so right now,	
this buttonpress event	
is just triggering	
a dummy procedure call	
how about this	
for the app name	
the surprisingly	
helpful equationlinked	
differential	
optimized numerator	
so it spells "sheldon"	
does it	
a happy accident	
we're not doing	
names now	
howard	
like i was saying, right now	
it's just a dummy procedure,	
but eventually,	
it will drop us into	
all right, fine	
if we're not going	
to give it a name,	
can we at least give it a secret code designation	
no	
hear me out	
the atomic bomb	
was the manhattan project	
windows  was originally	
project chicago	
for our app, i would humbly	
suggest project nodlehs	
that's just	
"sheldon" backwards	
another happy accident	
we're not wasting time with names right now	
i see	
is that decision open	
for discussion	
no	
is the decision to not	
discuss it open for discussion	
no	
again,	
right now it's just	
a dummy procedure,	
but eventually,	
it will drop us into	
i call for a vote of no confidence and an immediate change in leadership	
sheldon, stop it	
when in the course of human	
events, it becomes necessary	
to dissolve the bonds	
that tie three competent	
scientists together	
that's enough, sheldon	
all right, let's get right to the vote	
show of hands	
all those opposed	
to leonard	
and his reign of tyranny	
okay, that's it, you're fired	
really	
why	
because you're impossible	
to work with	
i see	
and is that open	
for discussion	
what are you doing	
oh good morning, shoemaker	
i think you'll be pleased	
with what the elves were up to	
last night	
i fired you	
oh, i know i'm now	
an independent contractor	
no, you are	
now nothing	
you have no connection	
to this project whatsoever	
but i made it better	
i don't want it better	
i want it my way	
well, that speaks volumes,	
doesn't it	
all right, i suppose	
i'll go put on my bus pants	
what the hell are bus pants	
they are pants one wears	
over one's regular pants	
when one sits on bus seats	
that other people	
have previously sat on	
but perhaps	
from your lofty heights	
atop the corporate ladder,	
you've lost touch	
with the struggles	
of the common man	
look, i'm still happy	
to drive you to work	
nothing's changed	
in that regard	
we're still roommates,	
we're still friends	
except you identified me,	
your best friend,	
as a gangrenous limb	
that needed to be severed	
from the organism	
and tossed away	
the desperate act	
of a little man	
with a big napoleon complex	
you know what	
go put on your bus pants	
mm last night,	
i had a dream	
we got so rich from the app,	
you and i bought matching	
sidebyside mansions	
but	
there was a secret tunnel	
connecting your front yard	
to my back yard	
what do you think that means	
it means after we play handball,	
i'm showering at home	
good morning, friend howard	
friend raj	
i see you gentlemen	
are enjoying beverages	
perhaps they would taste better	
out of these	
"world's greatest	
astrophysicist"	
don't thank me you earned it	
"howard wolowitz"	
why not	
"world's greatest engineer"	
i'm sorry	
i typed that	
into the label maker,	
but i just couldn't press enter	
now down to business	
what would it take for you to abandon leonard and join me in a rival company	
unless, of course,	
the mugs are sufficient,	
in which case, welcome aboard	
we're not quitting on leonard	
i understand	
your loyalty is admirable	
but what if i were	
to up the ante	
what are you talking about	
monogrammed key chains	
with a builtin laser pointer	
no	
how about can cozies	
emblazoned	
with our university mascot	
go, beavers	
i'll be back	
okay, let's try this one	
"spherical hankel function"	
hold on	
that's it	
eureka	
hey, we agreed when	
it was "eureka" time,	
we were all gonna	
say it together	
fine	
let's say it together	
no the moment	
has passed	
greetings, gentlemen	
how goes your	
little project	
you mean,	
"project lenwoloppali"	
ah, a combination	
of all your names	
very clever	
i assume "koothranardowitz"	
was taken	
we're actually	
scanning equations	
and getting good results	
oh, well then,	
by all means, carry on	
ž	
i wouldn't want	
to impede your progress	
howard, did you solve	
the install time problem yet	
no it's a little tricky	
i'm gonna try having it pick up	
the libraries dyn	
what are you doing	
playing the theremin	
no i mean, what are you	
doing with a theremin	
playing it	
i've loved the theremin	
from the first moment	
i heard the original	
star trek theme	
and it's been killing me	
that it just sits in my closet,	
gathering dust	
sheldon	
we're working here	
that's all right	
i can barely hear you	
over my theremin	
well, that was a	
little uncalled for	
no, that was	
completely called for	
we need quiet	
so, your project is more	
important than mine	
well, seeing as your project	
is to sabotage my project, yes	
don't beat around the bush,	
leonard	
if you don't want me here,	
just say the word,	
and i'll leave	
could have beaten	
around the bush a little	
nobody knows 	
the trouble i've seen	
nobody knows my sorrow 	
oh, oh, oh 	
what you doing	
trying to contact	
your home planet	
i'm practicing my theremin	
oh	
nobody knows 	
the trouble i've seen 	
glory, hallelujah	
something got you down,	
there, sheldon	
leonard kicked me out	
of my own apartment	
and his app team	
oh, honey, i'm sorry	
he wouldn't drive me	
to work today	
i had to wear	
my bus pants	
is that so	
yes	
and they're	
still sticky	
aw	
probably going to have	
to throw them away	
hey, you don't need leonard and his app	
you can make one with me	
with you	
seriously,	
i have a great idea for one	
is it better than your idea	
to move to los angeles	
and become a famous actress	
okay, look	
when you see someone	
wearing shoes you like,	
you just snap a picture of them,	
and the app goes on the internet	
to find out	
where you can buy them	
that's your app idea	
well, you don't like it	
i didn't say that	
but no, i don't	
why not	
oh, penny,	
where do i begin	
the simplemindedness	
of your idea	
is exceeded only by its	
crass consumerism and banality	
and leonard didn't want	
to work with you	
imagine that	
i know, it's baffling	
nobody knows	
the trouble i've seen	
sheldon, i'm gonna	
make some cocoa	
do you want some	
do you make it	
with milk or water	
milk	
real cocoa	
that's what it says	
on the packet	
do you have	
those little marshmallows	
no, sorry	
well, i suppose	
it's appropriate	
what does that mean	
a disappointing drink	
for a disappointing day	
hey, look at this	
people from the university	
have already signed up	
for our private beta	
i'm telling you,	
the lenwoloppali	
differential equation scanner	
meets a real need	
we've got a hit	
what do you think we	
should sell it for	
well, based on the fact	
that our potential market	
is about  or  guys,	
and you want a submarine,	
i'd say about a	
million dollars a pop	
well, what if we put out a lite	
version for half a million	
you know,	
get the word of mouth going	
hi i'm sorry	
to bother you guys,	
but you've got to come take your sheldon back	
what's he doing	
in your apartment	
well, he was moping down in the	
lobby, so i invited him over	
now i regret it	
why do you regret	
uh, never mind, stupid question	
look, can't you just let him play with you until bedtime	
we're not playing	
this is real work	
we're going to	
be hundredaires	
okay what if i got him	
to apologize	
and promise to behave	
then i guess we would	
let him back on the app team,	
and while we're doing that,	
you could take an aerial tour	
of la on your flying pig	
okay wait right here	
i'll tell you one thing	
if i get rich enough,	
that's the kind of girl i want	
to take on a submarine ride	
and yes, that time,	
i meant it to be dirty	
really	
leonard wants me back	
oh, yes he says they	
are lost without you	
well, we sure saw that coming	
that's right	
you know what	
i'm going to do	
i am going to sit here	
and just let them stew	
no, no, no you know,	
they have	
suffered enough	
everybody's	
suffered enough	
the thing is, you're going	
to have to offer him	
a facesaving	
way out of this	
how	
say you're sorry	
oh, no	
mrs mary cooper	
didn't raise her no liars	
okay um	
how about this  you know	
how you're always trying	
to learn about sarcasm	
no	
no	
i was being sarcastic	
oh good for you	
so all you have to do here is say you're sorry to leonard, but say it sarcastically	
of course	
he will hear it as an attempt	
to mend fences,	
as opposed	
to the withering condemnation	
you and i will know it to be	
yeah yeah, that	
was my plan	
all right	
come on let's go	
oh, by the way,	
thank you	
for the delicious cocoa	
oh, you're welcome	
boy, i'm getting	
good at this	
okay, now that you're	
back on the team,	
let's get you caught up	
before you begin,	
let me say again	
how deeply sorry i am	
for my earlier behavior	
and how much i respect	
and admire your leadership	
thank you	
so as you can see,	
not only can you store	
your favorite equations,	
but you can forward them	
to your friends	
or post them on facebook	
right from the app	
well, i must say,	
i am impressed	
thanks	
you all have clearly put	
in a lot of hard work	
we have	
as a result,	
you have taken	
the most important step	
on the road to success	
learning what not to do	
now, let's start fresh	
howard, we're going to need some tea	
okay, these are uggs	
these are crocs	
these are knockoff	
manolo blahniks	
bored	
look, you said it yourself,	
we have to create a database	
before you can write	
an algathingy	
algorithm	
you see, penny, alan turing	
defined an algorithm	
bored	
okay	
these are steve maddens	
these are nine west	
these are target oh, but don't	
they look like chanel	
these are	
michael kors	
nobody knows
