isn't the point	of a communal meal	
the exchange of ideas	
and opinions	
an opportunity to consider important issues of the day	
it is	you	
just kind of put a damper on things	
when you said,	"the next person i see talking	with food in their mouth will be put to death"	
well, we could argue about who said what all night long, but to set things back	on course,	
i will propose	a new topic of conversation	
great	what is the best number	
by the way, there's only one correct answer	
wrong the best number is	
you're probably wondering why	
no uhuh	
we're good	
is the st prime number	 its mirror, , is the th, and its mirror, ,	is the product of multiplying	
hang on to your hats	
seven and three	
eh eh did i lie	
we get it	
is the chuck norris of numbers		
chuck norris wishes	
in binary, is a palindrome "onezerozeroonezerozeroone" which backwards is "onezerozeroonezerozeroone"	
exactly the same	
all chuck norris backwards gets you is "sirron kcuhc"	
just for the record, when you enter ,, on a calculator, upsidedown it spells "boobies""	
remember when you were wondering why the girls didn't	 want to eat with us tonight	
yeah, i get it now	
i love your little heart locket, bernadette	
oh, thanks howard gave it to me	
it's the cutest thing	
every time i have dinner with his mom, the next day i get jewelry		
did you know that the iconic	valentine's heart shape	is not actually based on the shape of a human heart,	but rather on the shape of the buttocks of a female bending over	
oh, so i spent seventh grade	dotting my i's	with little asses cool	
hey, penny, how's it going	
hey, zack,	
what are you doing here	
my dad's company prints	the menus for this place	
i'm just dropping off some new ones laminated	makes 'em easier to clean if people throw up on 'em	
guess how i got the idea	
yeah, i got it, i got it	
uh, zack, these are my friends bernadette and amy	
hi	
hey	
hoo	
okay, well, it was good to see you	
yeah, you, too	
he's really cute	
how do you know him	
oh, we went out a couple of times	
i'm often flummoxed by current slang	
does "went out" mean "had intercourse"	
yes	
no, no	
but in this case, yes	
interesting and was it not satisfactory	
no, it was great	
he just didn't really challenge	me on an intellectual level	
couldn't you just fool around	with him and then listen to npr wouldn't help	
zack can't even spell npr	
it's what i do with howard	
i'm much smarter than he is	but it's important to protect his manhood	
hoo	
what's the matter	
i'm suddenly feeling flushed	
my heart rate is elevated, my palms are clammy, my mouth is dry	
in addition, i keep involuntarily saying "hoo"	
oh, we know what's causing that, don't we	
it's no mystery	
i obviously have the flu coupled with suddenonset tourette's syndrome	
did you hear about the accident at the bio lab	
no	
what happened	
they were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes and one of the techs got bit	
did he get superpowers	
no, he got five stitches and a tetanus shot	
oh well, that's disappointing	
why	
well, you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab, you kind of want to turn into a superhero	
yeah, but who'd want to become ratman	
who wouldn't	
you could zip through	a maze in nothing flat, squeeze through really small holes, and shut down restaurants in a single bound and the best part is, if i were ratman, you could be my	sidekick, mouse boy	
mouse boy	
you don't like "mouse boy"	
how about "kid vermin"	
first of all, if we had superpowers,	i wouldn't be the sidekick	
you'd be the sidekick	
ratman is nobody's sidekick	
leonard, settle this	
of the two of us, who's the obvious sidekick		
yeah, leonard, who	
years after high school,	 and i'm still at the nerd table	
aren't you slicing that	man's brain a little too thin	
it's too thin	
if i were making a footlong brain sandwich at quiznos for examination under a two photon microscope, it's fine	
well, you're the expert	
if the correct way to do it	is the wrong way, then i yield very well	
if you die and donate	your body to science, i promise to slice your brain	like canadian bacon	
thank you	
now, if you'll excuse me,	
i have to take my temperature	
are you monitoring your circadian rhythms in order to identify your periods	of maximum mental acuity	
i did that one summer	
ah, youth	
no, i experienced some	distressing symptoms last night,	so i'm checking	my vital signs every hour	
i'd be happy to create a chart and participate in a	 differential diagnosis	
oh, that sounds like fun	
all right		
what were the symptoms	
elevated heart rate, moist palms, dry mouth and localized vascular throbbing localized to what region ears and genitalia	
interesting	
not body parts	that usually team up	
what about environmental factors	
describe the scene for me	
i was sitting in a restaurant	with penny and bernadette, drinking water carbonated as it was a special occasion	
penny's friend zack stopped by	and said hello and i said "hoo"		
who	
zack	
then why did you ask	
ask what	
who	
zack	
all right, let's start over	
what did you say when zack walked in	
"hoo"	
zack	
why do you keep saying "zack"	
because you keep saying "who"	
i'm not saying "hoo" now	
i said "hoo" last night	
and the answer was zack,	
correct	
there was no question	
i simply said "hoo"	
all right, i think i have enough to go on	
possible explanations for your symptoms are, in descending order of likelihood hyperthyroidism,	premature menopause, hosting an alien parasite or and i only include it for the sake of covering	absolutely all bases	
sexual arousal	
where would i have picked up	an alien parasite	
there you are	
oh, hey	
let me ask you a question	
what are you most afraid of	
i don't know um	
nuclear war accidentally being	buried alive	
any of those movies where you get that phone call	that says you're going to die	
and then you dono something very specific that we both know you, rajesh koothrappali, are terrified of	
well, type two diabetes	runs in my family	
the thought of	losing a toe	
spiders	
you're afraid of spiders	
what the heck is this	
a jar with a big spider in it, of course	
bravery test	
first one to take his hand out is the sidekick	
are you crazy	
perhaps	
are you scared	
no but it's a stupid test	
oh, really	
what if the earth was in danger	
and the only way to save it was	
to stick your hand	
in a jar with a spider	
oh, yeah	
what if the earth was in danger and the only way	to save it was to take a shower in the locker room and let other guys see you naked	
oh, come on	
that's never gonna happen	
put your hand in the jar	
or forever be revealed	as my sidekick	
all right, i will	
how did you get so brave all of a sudden	
it's easy	
the spider's crawling up your arm	
get it off get it off	
please, raj	
please	
oh	
my blood work shows thyroid function normal cortisol levels normal	
how about your	folliclestimulating hormone	levels	
sheldon, i am not going	 through menopause	
are you sure	
you said that with the testy bark of an old biddy	
i think we need to face the cold, hard truth	
i was sexually aroused	by penny's friend zack	
hang on	
i don't know that we've given	the alien parasite hypothesis a fair shake	
let's look at this logically	
i have a stomach i get hungry	
i have genitals i have the potential for sexual arousal	
a cross we all must bear	
you know, in difficult	moments like this, i often turn to a force	greater than myself	
religion	
star trek	
did you see star trek the motion picture	
no	
don't	
it's terrible however in it, we learn that when spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic by feelings bubbling up from his	human half, he suppresses them	using the vulcan mental discipline of kolinar	
are you suggesting we live our lives	guided by the philosophies found in cheap science fiction	
"cheap science fiction"	
what are you doing	
using kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment	
is it possible that your concern for me at this moment is motivated by nothing more	than simple jealousy	
i hadn't considered that	
give me a moment	
all right, i've considered it and i reject i	
you reject it because you don't feel jealousy,	or because you are suppressing jealousy	
i think	i'll eat my lunch at home	
that's not your	lunch, sheldon	
those are the cadaver	brain specimens	
oh	
as they were incorrectly sliced,	you can see how i could mistake them for my sashimi	
hello	
hey isn't tomorrow your usual laundry night	
the supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener	
if this one under or oversoftens, i'll need time to make things right	
that's thinking ahead	
the alternative would be to think backwards	
that's just remembering	
so how's amy	
amy's changed	
i might have to let her go	
oh, no why	
i thought she was a highly evolved creature	of pure intellect, like me but recent events indicate that she may be a slave to her baser urges like you	
just going to	skip over that insult	
what insult	
yeah that's why		
i'm going to skip over it	
are you saying that amy is	
oh, what's the	scientific word	
forget science she's horny	
oh okay wow	
it's simple biology there's nothing i can do about it	
are you sure	
what are you suggesting	
i'm suggesting there might be something	you could do about amy's urges	
it's illegal to spay a human being	
yeah that's not	 what i had in mind	
oh	
oh	
you mean something i could do	
exactly	
well, i was hoping to avoid this but i might as well get it over with	
thank you, penny	
i'll let you know what happens	
oh, amy, you lucky girl	
yes this is dr sheldon cooper	
is this the zack johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbor penny	
sorry to bother you	
hello i'm looking for a zack johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbor penny	
coitus	
it means intercourse and i have a feeling i'm	speaking to the right zack	
this is sheldon cooper	
fine shelly	
yes, that does	sound like a girl's name	
no, it doesn't bother me	
yes, "smelly shelly" does bother me	
let me tell you why i'm calling	
i'd like to know if you'd be interested in having sex	 with amy farrah fowler	
amy farrah fowler	
yes, that is  a girl's name	
good grief it's like trying to talk to a dolphin	
really	
this is going to decide who's	the hero and who's the sidekick	
you got a better idea	
every idea is better than this idea	
ding	
wait what the hell is "ding"	
it's a bell	
i don't think this kind of wrestling has a bell	
fine how do you want to start	
i say, uh, how about one, two, three, go	
onetwothreego	
that's for babies	
okay, how about, uh on your mark, get set, go	
that's for a footrace	
if you want to race,	we have to go outside	
no, it's chilly outside	
didn't bring my jacket	
oh, for crying out loud	
what kind of superhero	needs a jacket	
what kind of superhero says,	
"dibs on the red tights dibs on the red tights"	
all right, how about this	
ready, wrestle	
wait are we starting now or	
is that what you're going to say when we do start, or we're starting now	
don't yell at me	
suppose there are worse ways to spend a friday night	
none come to mind	
look at this stamp	
on what authority are they permitted to mutilate patrons as they enter	
i'm sure it'll wash off	little comfort tonight	
i look like a hell's angel	
there's zack	
are you sure this is	what you want to do	
it's not what i want to do	
it's what i have to do	
go, amy farrah fowler	
follow your endocrine system	
thank you, sheldon	
you're a good friend	
please don't drag this out	
this is never going to come off	
excuse me	
zack, i am amy farrah fowler	
we met the other night	
i have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge until i met you, my decisions were founded in logic and reason and yet here i stand before you, pounds of raging estrogen, longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus and make shakespeare's metaphorical beast with two backs	my gluteus	
what on the other hand, as i look at the blank, apelike expression on your face, i have decided to adopt the vulcan practice of kolinar	
goodbye, zack	
bye	
hoo	
that should hold me for a while	
i'm legally obligated to inform you that i took a karate lesson when i was	
i'd be a regular ninja by now if my mom could've arranged a carpool	
oh, yeah	
well, i've been taking	pilates class at the rec center, and my abs look like sections of a hershey bar	
oh, yeah won't matter, you're going down	
no, uhuh, you're going down	
if anybody's going to go down,	it's going to be you	
fellas it's been minutes	
nobody's touched each other	
i'm glad you decided to reject your animal hindbrain and return to the realm of pure intellect	as am i	
what are you doing	
an experiment	
nope nothing	
never mind	
you realize you can't win	
i prefer to think that i can't lose	
you're wrong	
it's only a matter of time before you fall into ratman's rat trap	
you pathetic fool	
if there were a ratcatcher, wouldn't it catch ratman	
just because i didn't express myself well doesn't mean my underlying point was invalid	
you bloviating buffoon	
you narcissistic nincompoop	
you crimson coward	
oh, leonard, wake up,	
you're missing some very excellent superhero quips
