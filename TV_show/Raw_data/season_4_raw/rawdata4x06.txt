problem	
this is the worst cobbler	
i've ever eaten	
it tastes like it's made of actual groundup shoemaker	
amusing a play on the two meanings of "cobbler"	
hey, guys guess who	
i found at lax	
my baby sister priya	
excuse me, i object you propose a guessing game,	
yet you don't give me enough time to guess	
for the record,	
i was going to say	
"your sister priya"	
oh, sheldon you haven't	changed a bit, have you	
why would i change the hope has been that	
you'd eventually bend	
to public opinion	
so, priya, what brings	
you back to la	
i have a oneday layover	
on my way to toronto	
corporate merger	
can you believe it	
little priya's one of the lead attorneys	
for the biggest car company in india	
given that when we met her,	
she was finishing law school	
and planning an internship	
at a large indian car company,	
it's actually	
extremely plausible	
and your poll numbers just keep dropping	
i want to catch up with all of you,	
but first i really must visit the loo	
i'm going, too i'll	
show you where it is	
all right, this goes	
without saying,	
but i'm just going to say it anyway	
hands off my sister	
why would i touch her she's	
covered with airplane germs	
i'm so not talking to you	
i'm talking to him	
hey i've got a girlfriend now	
oh, please	
my sister's much hotter	
than your girlfriend,	
and you know it	
let's just agree	
they're both hot	
but dude, that's my sister	
you're talking about	
okay, forget who's hotter	
the first time priya came to	
la, leonard and i made a pact out of respect to our friendship and to you	
that neither of us	
would hit on her	
did you pinkyswear	
yes	
okay, then	
cobbler i'm still laughing	
it's really nice	
to see you again, leonard	
yeah it's good	
to see you, too	
here you go	
thanks	
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa	
okay	
so you got any special plans	
with your sister	
oh, not really just hang out	
i always tell people,	
"if you have only one day in los angeles, make it a train day"	
train day	
the fun starts with brunch	
at carney's in studio city,	
a hotdog stand in a	
converted railroad dining car	
next stop, travel town,	
an outdoor museum featuring	
railroad engines,	
cars, and other rolling stock	
from the s to the s	
and, finally, we're off to the	
glitz and glamour of hollywood,	
for dinner atthat's right	
the hollywood carney's,	
a hotdog stand in a different	
converted railroad dining car	
i don't think	
we're going to do that	
well, then apparently	
you hate fun	
priya's not back yet	
well, i guess	
that's not unusual	
women, men, the whole	
sittingstanding deal	
so what are we talking about	
uh, my plans with priya	
he rejected train day	
did you make it clear that	
it's two different train cars turned into hotdog stands	
abundantly	
i guess he just hates fun	
that's what i said	
okay, so what's	
new with you guys	
i have a girlfriend now	
hey, good for you	
yeah, i just want to put it out there	
in case i inadvertently	squirt any pheromones	
in your direction	
happy	
so, priya, what are your plans while you're here	
i don't know i just have the one day	
do you like trains	
not particularly	
you might as well just wait	
at the airport for your flight	
"you are in a forest	
"there is quicksand to the west,	
a path leads to the east"	
go east	
"an iron gate blocks your way"	
open gate	
"it's locked"	
hmm	
well, so much for that	
it's getting pretty late	
how come you're still up	
i found an emulator online that	
lets you play classic textbased	
computer games from the s	
that's pretty cool	
oh, yes it runs on the world's	
most powerful graphics chip	
imagination	
you've really got to get out more	
go north	
"you can't go that way"	
go west	
"a troll blocks your passage"	
okay fasten your seatbelts	
kill troll	
"with what"	
with sword	
"you don't have the sword"	
good golly, it's as if it's actually happening to me	
raj finally went to bed	
sheldon's still up	
you said he goes to bed at	
yeah, he does, but he got caught	
up in a computer game and	
sheldon hit troll with axe	
hit troll with axe	
hit troll with axe	
my, this is one tough troll	
can't you get rid of him	
if the past is any indication, no	
sheldon	
leonard, i'm trapped	
in quicksand	
the axe is dragging me down	
drop axe	
sheldon	
drop axe, brilliant	
give me a minute	
sheldon	
hold on	
trying to figure out	
how to get the bucket,	
so i can carry the mud	
past the dragon	
sheldon, you need to work in the morning	
i know	
well, then bed, mister	
five more minutes	
really	
you're going to risk getting	
sleepy in the middle of your	
thermodynamic	
fluctuations seminar	
you know what happens	
when you yawn in public	
everyone will see	
my oddly shaped uvula	
you don't want that, do you	
no	
but it's a shame our society	
mocks the differently uvulated	
who was at the door	
uh, building manager	
they have to fix a pipe,	
so the water'll be off	
tomorrow from noon to	
that's unacceptable	
we're supposed to be	
given written notice	
well, no, it doesn't matter	
we'll be at work	
what if i spill tomato	
soup on my shirt,	
and have to come home to change,	
only to find there's no water	
for an enzyme soak	
bifurcated uvula, sheldon	
i'll have the chicken noodle	
good night	
we're going to have to be very quiet	
sheldon	
i know how to get the bucket	
i can turn the axe around	
and use the handle to reach it	
let's see	
go north	
"you are in a forest"	
go north	
"you are in a forest"	
(typing)	
go north	
"you are in a forest"	
oh dear, i believe i'm lost	
well, i'll just have to get	
a fresh start tomorrow	
no, no, no you just	
took a wrong turn	
you just need to map it out	
come on, i'll help you	
so you stopped at the stream,	
and you turned	
north three times	
yes	
you're right	
you're lost good luck	
oh	
leonard wake up	
huh wh sorry	
for what	
i don't know when i'm in bed	
with a girl, it's just	
it's my goto response	
it's  i have to get back to raj's	
before he wakes up	
and realizes i'm gone	
oh right sure	
i wish you could stay	
in la a while longer	
mmm, me, too	
you know, i was thinking	
there are some great	
research facilities in india	
where are you going with this, leonard	
well, i'm just saying, you know,	
i don't have any real ties here,	
so if i were to move to new	
delhi, we could, you know	
go out	
leonard, didn't we have this	
conversation five years ago	
well, yes, but	
things have changed	
you know, you're older,	
i'm older	
look, no more	
superhero bed sheets	
sweetheart,	
just because we have fun when	
i come to town doesn't mean	
i want to have a	
serious relationship	
it doesn't	
mmmm	
and besides, i could never bring	
a white boy home to my parents	
they'd have a cow	
which is a much	
bigger deal in india	
i'm not that white	
my greatgreatgrandmother	
was half cherokee	
i know that's not the right kind	
of indian, but it is something	
you're funny	
sheldon leonard	
leonard	
what	
i heard a woman laughing	
oh, uh, yeah i was trying to	
see if i could laugh as a woman	
oh well, good job	
quite convincing	
i smell perfume	
air freshener	
and is that lipstick	
on your cheek and neck	
rash that's a bad rash	
my sympathies	
i'm no stranger to the crimson	
scourge that is dermatitis	
can i interest you	
in a topical steroid	
from my lotion and	
unguent collection	
uh, yeah, yeah,	
that sounds great	
very well i'm sure	
i can find something	
that will help	
you ditch that itch	
okay, he's in the bathroom	
let's go	
do you prefer	
ointment or cream	
cream	
with or without a numbing agent	
without	
really, leonard	
there are no heroes when	
it comes to dermatitis	
fine with	
prescription or	
nonprescription strength	
use your best judgment	
well, i think i have a	
nice  anamantle hc	
it's usually indicated for	
acutely inflamed hemorrhoids,	
but it also goes nicely	
with nonmucosal body parts	
sounds great	
excellent choice	
okay, hurry, hurry, hurry	
come on, come on, come on	
sheldon	
priya	
good morning, sheldon	
for shame, leonard, for shame	
and to think,	
i was ready to waste	
the last of my good	
hemorrhoid cream on you	
making pretty	
good time, huh	
is that really what you want	
to talk about, leonard	
no	
what do you want to talk about	
please don't tell anyone i spent the night with raj's sister	
there it is	
what if someone asks	
no one's going to ask if i spent	
the night with raj's sister	
perhaps, but they might ask me	
something else	
like what	
like	
"has leonard betrayed any	
of his friends recently"	
priya and i are both adults	
i didn't betray raj	
in fact, you did,	
but i was referring to howard	
what are you talking about	
april ,	
bob's big boy,	
toluca lake	
raj had just introduced us	
to priya for the first time	
she was enjoying the sweet taste	
of hindu rebellion	
in the form of a bob's	
super big boy hamburger	
in order	
to preserve	
your friendship, you and howard	
made a pinky swear	
that neither of you	
would attempt to woo her	
i had a patty melt	
okay, fine, i betrayed howard	
and raj	
all right, and raj	
and me	
you	
violation of the	
roommate agreement's	
overnight guest	
notification clause	
okay, fine,	
ii'm a horrible human being	
i'm the darth vader of pasadena	
you're far too short	
to be darth vader	
at best you might be	
a turncoat ewok	
my point is priya's gone	
and it would be much better	
if no one else found out	
about us	
you mean you want me	
to keep a secret	
yes	
you know i can't	
keep a secret	
you can if you try	
think about	
it this way	
um, if i were batman	
and you were alfred,	
you'd keep that	
secret, right	
why do you get	
to be batman	
because batman has the secret	
alfred has secrets, too	
like what	
alfred knows	
that barbara gordon	
is batgirl	
which i've now just	
told to batman	
see, i cannot	
keep a secret	
tadah	
what	
tadah	
it's short for	
♪ dadadada ♪	
kind of busy here, sheldon	
i know,	
that's why i shortened it	
what do you want	
i came to go over your alibi	
for last night	
what alibi	
you've asked me	
to lie on your behalf,	
and as you know,	
i am deeply uncomfortable	
with impromptu dishonesty,	
so i've provided you	
with an ironclad alibi	
you couldn't have spent	
last night with priya	
because you were	
with another woman	
oh, i'm so sure	
i'm gonna regret this,	
but who was i with	
the funloving and morally loose	
miss maggie mcgarry	
oh, god	
you met her at pasadena's most	
popular irish watering hole,	
lucky baldwin's, where maggie	
spends her nights tending bar	
with a head full of curls	
and a heart full of dreams	
"leonard, call me if you	
are interested in coitus	
sincerely,	
maggie mcgarry"	
and if anyone were	
to actually call that number,	
they will hear this	
female texttospeech voice	
top of the morning to you	
you've reached maggie mcgarry	
leave a message	
after the wee little beep	
it's pretty convincing, huh	
that wasn't even	
a real person	
and here is	
the clincher	
a lock of maggie's	
flaming auburn hair	
where'd you get that	
from an orangutan	
in the primate lab	
an orangutan	
well, no one's going	
to run a dna test	
on it, leonard	
honestly, you overthink	
everything	
sheldon, i don't need an alibi	
nobody's going to ask	
about last night	
as long as you just	
zip your lip	
thank you	
now, don't worry,	
everything is going to be fine	
hey	
hey, leonard, will you please tell howard my sister has never been attracted to him	
come on, raj,	
how am i supposed to know	
who she is attracted to	
or was attracted to	
or who she might be	
attracted to in the future	
and i have nothing	
to contribute	
to this conversation	
because i, too,	
know absolutely nothing	
about priya's preferences	
in male companionship	
and with that,	
i will rezip my lip	
hey, so what did you guys think	of the new episode of caprica last night	
i didn't see it	
didn't see it	
what were you doing	
uh, i was out	
what, on caprica night	
yeah, i, uh, went	
for a drink	
really, you	
where, wwhere'd	
you go	
to, uh	
lucky baldwin's	
oh, i've heard	
of that place	
isn't that pasadena's	
favorite irish watering hole	
yes	
did you meet	
anyone interesting there,	
perhaps a promiscuous,	
redheaded barmaid	
as a matter of fact	
iiiii can't, i can't,	
i can't do it	
sure you can, you're doing	
fine, it's very believable	
i'm sorry, raj,	
but the truth is,	
i was with priya	
last night	
don't listen to him	
he's still lightheaded	
from all the irish whiskey	
and pickled eggs	
in his system	
what were you doing	
with priya	
i believe they engaged	
in coitus,	
but more	
importantly,	
if leonard had not abandoned	
his story,	
would you have found it	
plausible	
you slept with my sister	
yeah	
how could you	
we had a pact	
excuse me, i think	
"how could you she's my sister"	
takes precedence over	
a fiveyearold pinky swear	
may i point out,	
in a parallel universe,	
your friends are saying	
"maggie mcgarry	
she sounds lovely"	
look, ii admit it, i may	
have crossed a line here,	
but come on, raj, your	
sister is a grown woman,	
and to her, i'm a forbidden	
piece of white chocolate	
koothrappali	
i don't believe it	
this is a terrible	
betrayal of my trust	
no, wwwould it help if i told you	
that i offered her my heart,	
and she kind of stomped on it	
how hard did she stomp	
very hard	
okay, i'm good	
well, raj,	
i just want to say that i'd	
never betray your trust	
unlike leonard,	
i respect you	
really	
mmhmm	
was it out of respect	
that you didn't tell raj	
about the time you dropped	
his iphone in a urinal	
dude, i put that thing	
on my face	
i think a more amusing	
violation of raj's trust	
is when howard convinced him	
that foreigners give presents	
to americans	
on thanksgiving	
hey, i didn't see	
you giving back	
your snoopy	
snow cone maker	
that was all a lie	
this year's gifts	
are already wrapped	
and as long as we're talking	
about betraying our friends,	
how about the month sheldon	
spent grinding up insects	
and mixing them	
into leonard's food	
sheldon	
well, excuse me	
that was not a betrayal	
that was an experiment	
to determine	
at what concentration	
food starts tasting "mothy"	
you put moths in my food	
for science	
i can't believe you kissed	
my sister with moth mouth	
well, i can't believe you	
used sheldon's toothbrush	
you used my toothbrush	
not the brush part,	
just the little rubber thing	
to pick food from my teeth	
and massage my gums	
okay, ii think	
it's safe to say	
that we've all done	
some things	
we're not	
particularly proud of	
but come on,	
we're friends	
friends overlook	
each other's minor lapses	
for the record, howard, i'm	
sorry that i broke our pact	
thank you	
and i'm sorry	
about your phone	
and thanksgiving	
and while we're at it,	
you don't have to wash our	
clothes on the fourth of july	
as long as we're apologizing,	
sheldon, i'm, i'm sorry	
i used your toothbrush	
and i'm sorry	
but that behavior	
is beyond the pale	
and cannot be tolerated	
we are no longer friends	
i got you a talking thomas the	
tank engine for thanksgiving	
with real puffing smoke	
yes	
all right	
but i'm watching you	
hey, you've got snoopy out	
can i have a snow cone	
well, sure	
this is pretty good	
what flavor is this	
guess	
papaya	
no	
guava	
you're so close	
i give up	
mango caterpillar	
what are	
you doing	
you said you	
liked it
