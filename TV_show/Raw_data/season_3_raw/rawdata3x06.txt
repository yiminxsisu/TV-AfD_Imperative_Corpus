kites, ho	
kites, ho	
excuse me	
you're misusing the word "ho"	
it's an interjection	
used to call attention	
to a destination, not an object,	
as in "land, ho" or "westward, ho"	
kites, ho	
hey, guys whatcha doin'	
going out to discover electricity	
if you're referring to the work of benjamin franklin,	
he did not "discover electricity,"	
he merely used a kite to determine	
that lignining consists of electricity	
he also invented the franklin stove,	
bifocals and the flexible	
urinary catheter	
kites, ho	
we're heading for some kite fighting	
"kite fighting"	
it's an extremely competitive, cutthroat sport	
actually, the risk of throat cutting is very low	
on the other hand, severe string burn is a real and everpresent danger	
you want to come watch	
gee sounds amazing	
but, i've got some friends coming over	
not a big thing	
we're gonna watch the nebraska game	
football, sure	
good guess	
i would've invited you,	
but you're not a football fan	
no, no, i'm not, so great	
you've got plans doing something you like,	
i've got plans doing something i like,	
it's good	
maybe we'll hang out later,	
after everybody's gone	
yeah, great	
see ya	
well, this sucks	
i'm sorry, i got bored	
and drifted off	
where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie	
leonard realized that penny's been hiding him from her friends	
because he's a tiny, little man	
who flies kites	
that certainly would suck	
wolowitz is trying to outflank us	
let out some string, add altitude	
and i'll go under and cut his line	
why wouldn't penny want	her friends to meet me	
focus, leonard, focus	
the heat of battle is upon us	
the dogs of war are unleashed	
maybe koothrappali's right	
maybe i embarrass her	
you're embarrassing me	
a grown man worrying about such nonsense	
when in the middle of flying kites	
sorry	
sorry won't bring their kites down	
string burn	
they think we're flanking	
they're playing right into our hands	
on the count of three, we execute the flying scissor	
one, two	
did you see that	
what	
that chick, she smiled at me	
no	
yes, she did	
come on, scissors, scissors	
hold my line	
what are you doing	
i can't scissors by myself	
come back	
victory	
son of a bitch	
you're a sucky friend,	
you know that	
a sucky, sucky friend	
what was i supposed to do	
she gave me that "comehit her" look	
if she gave you any look at all,	
it was a "you suck" look	
i would've caught up to her	
if i hadn't pulled a hammy	
please, you weigh  pounds	
you don't have a hammy	
penny doesn't want me around her friends	
i embarrass her	
what else could it be	
her actions could be out of concern for your feelings	
perhaps she's excluded you from these gatherings	
because she's scouting for a new mate	
and doesn't want to do it in front of you	
how kind of her	
agreed	
most primates don't show that sort of discretion	
a female bonobo will copulate	
with a new male in front of the old one	
without so much	as a "how do you do"	
you always do this	
you ditch me for a woman you don't have a shot with	
i had a shot	
with a woman you were chasing through a park	
that's not a shot, that's a felony	
what's worse, it cost me	
my prized patang fighting kite	
i don't suppose there's any chance	
you could give me my kite back	
i'm sorry, raj,	
but the rules of aerial warfare	dictate that the fallen kite	
go to the victor	
and without rules,	
the competition has no meaning	
and without meaning,	
the following would be an empty gesture	
i have your kite	
i have your kite	
how was your football party	
it was pretty good	
we won	
that's excellent	
it's a weird figure of speech	
"we won" when you weren't actually playing	
when we watch star wars, we don't say,	
"we defeated the empire "	
i'm glad to hear it	
on a related subject,	
are you embarrassed to have me around your friends	
oh, my god, no	
why would you ask that	
you know, i just noticed	
i haven't really met any of them	
sure you have	
i met the huge exboyfriend	
and the smaller yet still larger than me exboyfriend	
by the way, were they here today	
of course not	
why would they be	
why would i ask why am i rambling	
why don't you stop me	
if you want to meet my friends,	
that would be great	
you know, i didn't want you to be bored	
i wouldn't be bored	
why would i be bored	
'cause they're not genius scientists	
penny, i like all sorts of people	
some of my best friends	
aren't geniuses	
like who	
some of my facebook friends aren't geniuses	
my point is,	
if we're going to be a couple,	
i should be friends with your friends	
great	
then come over next saturday	
and watch the game with us	
another football game	
they have them every week	
did not know that	
you wanted to meet my friends	
sure	
just i don't know much about football	
a lot of the guys' girlfriends don't know football	
they just kind of drink	
and talk in the kitchen	
great	
okay, a completed pass	
first down, new england	
i think i'm starting to get this	
really	
the only thing i've learned is that american men love drinking beer, pee too often and have trouble getting erections	
focus on the game,	
not the commercials	
maybe if you people cut back on the beer, you could get out of the bathroom and satisfy your women without pharmaceutical help	
raj, what are you doing here	
you were supposed to help me	
pimp out my vespa	
i'm sorry, are you under the impression	
that we're still friends	
come on	
you're not still grinding on the kite thing, are you	
it's not just the kite thing	
every time we go some place,	
you think you can dump me	
when someone prettier comes along, even though you don't have a shot with them	
i had a shot with that jogger	
fine paint green flames on your little scooter with her	
it's not a little scooter	
it's the second biggest	
vespa they make	
are you watching football	
there's no fooling you	
now, what is this sacks statistic	
they put up there	
all i know about saks is my mother shops there	
sacks, sacks	
it's football nomenclature for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage	
scrimmage	
the line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line separating the offense from the defense	
sheldon knows football	
apparently	
i mean, quidditch, sure	
but football	
sheldon, how do you know this stuff	
i grew up in texas	
football is ubiquitous in texas	
pro football, college football,	
high school football,	
peewee football	
in fact, every form of football	
except the original european football	
which most texans believe to be a commie plot	
unbelievable	
if you're interested,	
i also know all about frying meat that isn't chicken	
as if it were chicken	
so you could teach me	
football or chickenfried meats	
football	
i'm going to penny's to watch a game with her friends	
and i don't want to look like an idiot	
i want to blend in	
if you want to blend in	
i'd think looking like an idiot	
would be the perfect camouflage	
come on, please teach me	
about football it'll be fun	
that's exactly what my father said	
"come to the games	
watch the games"	
week in and week out	
from the time i was five	
until i went off to college	
longest seven years of my life	
please, i'm asking you as a friend	
are you making this a tier one friendship request	
fine	
i really appreciate this	
all right, poindexter,	
sit down, shut up and listen	
i'm sorry	
that's how my father always began	
our football conversations	
and if you'd like, after the game,	
i'll take you outside	
and teach you how to shoot close enough	
to a raccoon that it craps itself	
when are you going to stop making cylon toast	
when i have enough to destroy all the human toast on the battlestar	
known as galactica	
is that what you're wearing to watch football at penny's	
what's wrong with a football jersey	
nothing	
that, however, appears to be a football cocktail dress	
it's the smallest size they had,	
except the one for dogs	
i can't believe	
they had one for dogs	
oh, yes	
canine football fans	
are a common sight in texas	
cats, however,	refuse to wear sporting apparel	
my sister found that out	
the hard way	
anyway, wish me luck	
leonard, wait	
am i correct in assuming	
that your attempt to be accepted by penny's peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her	
well, i wouldn't put it	
exactly that way	
how would you put it	
like you said	
seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse	
don't you have access to women who will do it for money	
by the way,	
another accepted usage	
for the term "ho"	
goodbye, sheldon	
hold on	
i believe that social convention	
dictate you not arrive emptyhanded	
would you like to bring some cylon toast	
yeah, no, i'm trying to fit in,	
not get laughed at	
what's funny about cylon toast	
it's open	
hey, pal	
what do you want	
i brought you a little gift	
new kite	
the kite you made me lose was an authentic patang,	
an indian fighting kite that my brother	sent to me from new delhi	
it took me a day to put together	
and two days to paint	
this is hello kitty	
yeah, but it comes with a little coin purse	
does a patang	
you just don't get it, do you	
buying me something pretty isn't going to make our problem just go away	
look, i admit i haven't always been	
the best friend i could be	
you've been a sucky friend,	
a sucky, sucky friend	
stipulated	
and you do it all the time	
last week in the mall,	
we were looking for a phone with giant numbers for your mother,	
and i suddenly realize you're not even there	
i know	
and where were you	
getting shot down by the girl at hot dog on a stick	
but in my defense, she was gorgeous	
and working that squeezer to make the lemonade,	
going up and down and up and down	
it was like a free pole dance	
right in the middle of the food court	
you're impossible	
at least, i can talk to women without being drunk	
excuse me, i have selective mutism,	
a recognized medical disorder	
you're just a douche	
no you know what	
maybe that's what	
this whole thing's about	
you're not mad at me,	
you're mad at yourself	
no, i'm mad at you	
i hate myself, but i'm mad at you	
fine you're mad at me	
i get it	
how about we go	spend the day together	
just the two of us	
we'll go anywhere you want	
i don't know	
come on	
let me take you someplace nice	
i do enjoy the la brea tar pits	
really, now	
with the traffic and the parking	
okay, fine	
the tar pits let's go	
why can't i stay mad at you	
are you people watching this	
is this amazing or what	
sweetie, that's a highlight	
from the ' championship game	
did not know that	
how much beer have you had	
none, why	
i was just hoping you were drunk	
now we're back live	
okay, yeah	
i can see the difference	
oh, where's the flag	
that's intentional grounding	
totally	
that completely was a forward pass,	
which they threw incomplete to avoid loss of yardage	
or to conserve time	
i can't believe they're not penalized with the loss of a down	
and by having to move the scrimmage line	
back to the spot of the foul	
here, have some pizza, sweetie	
you know i'm lactose intolerant	
i know	
i just need you to stop talking	
sheldon, come in	
thank you	
i'd like to make a sandwich,	
but i'm out of bread	
there's some in the fridge	
you shouldn't keep it	
in the refrigerator	
staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules,	
which occurs faster at cool temperatures	
on earth, we say "thank you"	
how goes the mimesis	
"mimesis"	
you know	
mimesis	
an action in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism	
mimesis	
what the hell are you talking about	
i'm attempting to communicate with you	
without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you	
let me try again	
have the indigenous fauna ccepted you as one of their own	
nudge, nudge, wink, wink	
oh, i guess so	
good	
oh, fyi	
after i eat my sandwich,	
i'm taking koothrappali's	
patang kite out for a test run	
would you like to get your deltawing raptor and join me	
i don't want to fly kites, sheldon	
we're watching football here	
i can see that	
i was providing you with an alternative	
a courtesy i was never offered	
in similar circumstances	
look at that	
the oklahoma coach	
has thrown down a red flag,	
indicating he's challenging	
the ruling on the field	
i hope he's right, 'cause if he's not,	
it'll cost him one of his timeouts	
you know, leonard, honey,	
i wouldn't mind if you wanted to go fly kites with sheldon	
i'll watch the end of the game	
there's only three minutes left	
until halftime	
this is just half	
we've been here for hours	
you'll be here for a couple more	
you're kidding me	
no	
nice meeting all of you	
so, yeah, anyway,	
that's my boyfriend	
he is really smart	
i really like my sabertoothed cat	
thank you	
my pleasure	
maybe after lunch,	
we can go to marie callender's	
and have some pie	
i'd like that	
this is turning out	
to be a perfect saturday	
good i'm glad	
did you see the way	
she smiled at me	
fine go ahead	
no this is our day	
if you want to chase after her,	
chase after her	
ah, who am i kidding	
i wouldn't have a shot	
with a girl like that	
don't put yourself down	
you're a very attractive man	
you think so	
absolutely it wouldn't kill you to take	
a pilates class with me now and then,	
but you have a certain wiry appeal	
yeah, well, it doesn't matter	
'cause she wasn't really smiling at me	
actually, i think she was	
really	
yeah	
what a douche
