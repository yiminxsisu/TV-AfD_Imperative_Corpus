okay, we've got power to the laser	
i should've brought an umbrella	
what for it's not going to rain	
i know that, but with skin as fair as mine, moon burn is a real possibility	
that's a "bazinga," right	
one of my best, don't you think	
howard, do you want to doublecheck the equatorial mount	on the laser we need it locked onto the sea of tranquility	
you got it	
oh, raj, no billions of dollars have gone into inventing the internet and filling it with pictures of naked women, so we don't have to peep through windows	
it's not like that i'm watching someone's tv the good wife is on	
i tell you, this is my new grey's anatomy	
leonard, leonard what is that what is that	
relax, it's just a dirty sock	
how on earth can you say "dirty sock" and "relax" in the same sentence	
sheldon, the world is filled with dirty discarded socks	
not my world	
hey, you know who'd really dig seeing this experiment penny	
i wasn't aware that lunar ranging was her thing	although, i suppose the retroreflector left on the moon by neil armstrong does qualify as a shiny object	
why don't you ask her to come up	
i don't know, it's still a little weird	since, you know	
she dumped you	
she didn't dump me we were just in different places in the relationship	
i fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities	of a geographic location	
oh, it's very simple leonard was living	in a little town called "please don't leave me"	while penny had just moved to the island of "buhbye"	
screw you guys i'm gonna go see if she's home	
if it's not too much trouble, i'd like to point this at the moon now	
wait a second	
the good wife is crying	something's very wrong	
oh, hi	
what's going on	
we're up on the roof bouncin laser beams off the moon	
i'm sorry, what	
it's pretty cool we've got a twometer parabolic reflector and everything i thought you might want to see it	
that makes no sense	
um	
how can you bounce stuff off the moon there's no gravity	
uh, leonard, this is zack zack, leonard	
hey	
oh, sorry, i didn't know you were busy maybe another time	
yeah, maybe	
hey, i want to see this laser thing	
oh, but what about the party	
it's a surprise party doesn't matter when we get there	
okay, well, yeah, come on up	
so, how'd you two guys meet	
my company designs the menus for the cheesecake factory	
your company	
well, my dad, but but me and my sister are vps	
so menus	
i know it sounds easy but there's a lot	of science that goes in designing one	
happy now i'm moving the dirty sock	
thank you	
raj, keep an eye out for other one	
hey, guys, this is my friend zack	
hey	
hello whoa is that the laser it's bitchin'	
yes in , when albert einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper "zur quantentheorie der strahlung," his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin'	
well, mission accomplished	
let me explain what we're doing here	um, in , the astronauts on apollo positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon, and we're going to shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier	
oh that's very cool	
one question how can you be sure it won't blow up	
the laser	
the moon	
see, now this is a man for penny	
that's a great question, zack	
no, it's not penny	
sheldon play nice	
it's not a great question	
how could somebody possibly think we're going to blow up the moon	
that's a great question		
don't worry about the moon	
wewe set our laser to stun	
smart	
now, we'll be able to see the beam when it leaves, but it won't be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye	
naked	
right uh funny uh, that device, there, will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer	
raj, get them some glasses	
cool, it's gonna be in d	
preparing to fire laser at the moon	
make it so	
there it is there's the spike	
seconds for the light to return	
that's the moon we hit the moon	
that's your big experiment all that for a line on the screen leonard	
yeah, but, uh, think about what this represents	
the fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man made objects on the moon, put there by a member of a species that only  years before had just invented the airplane	
what species is that	
i was wrong penny can do better	
okay, guys, thank you, it's been fun	
yeah, thanks	
should we invite them to the party	
no, just keep walking	
he must be very skilled at coitus	
i'm telling you, dude, the only way to feel better about penny going out with other guys is for you to get back on the whores	
horse	
what	
the phrase is "get back on the horse," not "whores"	
that's disgusting, dude	
no, it's not	
never mind	
he is right, though if you want, i can turn you on to this great new dating site i found	
no, thanks	
you sure they say they can find a match for anybody	
have they found a match for you	
tons i've had, like, eight dates in the last month and if you count the ones who showed up and left	
i can't bring the nitrogen tank down	
why not	
all right, let me restate that it's very heavy, and i don't want to	
i'll help you	
thank you	
lift with your knees, not your back	
good night	
you know what would be fun signing sheldon up for online dating	
yeah, right	
no, think about it	
we make it an experiment like when frankenstein's monster was lonely and he found a wife	
he didn't find a wife they built him a wife out of dead body parts	
okay, we'll call that plan b	
coming		
damn you, you rat bastard	
are you drunk	
zack was a perfectly nice guy, and then you ruined him	
how did i ruin him	
'cause in the olden days, i never would've known he was so stupid	
come on, he wasn't that stupid	
yes, he was he thought you were gonna blow up the moon	
okay, yeah, he's stupid	
he spent the entire night bragging about how he invented the word "appeteasers"	
how is that my fault	
you have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots now, come with me	
whwhere are we going	
we're gonna have sex	
why i mean, okay	
what's going on	
put on your noise canceling headphones,	
'cause it's gonna get loud	
oh not this again	
in what universe is this low pulp	
good morning, penny	
what, do you have eyes in the back of your head	
when one gets beaten up every other day in school, one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing incidentally, one can get beaten up in school simply by referring to oneself as "one"	
i'm making english muffins would you like an english muffin	
oh, thanks, i'm not hungry fyi, my noise canceling headphones proved ineffective last night	
yeah, sorry about that	
as a native texan, i must say i've never heard the phrase "yeehaw"	 used in quite that context	
oh, god	
"oh, god" that i've heard on multiple occasions	
in what universe is that lightly toasted this has to be the worst day of my life	
good morning, leonard	
how many times have i asked you not to do that counting this instance	
where's penny	
she returned to her apartment i presume to shower and vomit not necessarily in that order	
i wonder why she didn't say goodbye	
are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behavior	
i know i just thought as an outsider, you might be able to provide a fresh perspective	
i have no difficulty believing you're not butter	
oh, hey	
oh, hi	
um, i gotta run early shift	
okay, i'll walk down with you so, last night was fun, huh	
yeah, it must have been i just threw up in my closet	
bummer anyway, i was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie	
oh, yeah, tonight's not great for me	
doesn't have to be tonight i'm free pretty much always	
leonard, last night was a mistake	
when you say "mistake," do you mean a fortunate mistake, like the discovery of penicillin	
look, i'm sorry i was drunk, i was lonely, i hated zack can we just forget it ever happened	
no, it's pretty well imprinted on my brain especially the whole rodeo thing	
oh, god	
so, that's it wham, bam, thank you, leonard	
look, i said i'm sorry can't you please let it go	
how am i supposed to let it go you used me for sex morning, mrs gunderson	
good morning, leonard or should i say "yeehaw"	
holy crap	
what	
we finally have proof that aliens walk among us	
excuse me	
the dating site matched a woman with sheldon	
you're kidding an actual woman	
yeah, look	
breasts and everything	
trust me, breasts doesn' necessarily mean woman	
since when	
i'll show you a picture of my uncle louie in a bathing suit sometime	
leonard, you gotta see this	
we found a match for sheldon	
great maybe she can have sex with him, and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a "how do you do"	
do you know what he's talking about	
nope	
why don't you ask him	
leonard, what are you talking about	
i don't want to talk about it	
that was a lousy suggestion	
whatever right now, dr sheldon cooper has to send an email to his perfect match	
"greetings, fellow lifeform"	
if she can do it, i can do it if she can do it, i can do it if she can do it, i can do it i can't do it	
hello	
oh, hi hey hi, leslie	
leonard hofstadter what're you doing here	
uh, i know it's been a while	
yeah,  months	
right right so how you doing	
fine you	
uh, not bad you remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didn't mean anything, it was just for fun	
yeah	
you, uh, want to do that again	
what happened blondie dumped you	
she didn't dump me we were just in different places in the relationship	
right	
um anyway, apparently, it's okay to go back to people you're no longer seeing and have recreational sex with them	
uhhuh	
so, what do you say	
let me think about it	
she's not coming back	
uhoh she wants to meet us	
not us him	
yes, but him doesn't even know about her	
well, him about to find out about her	
really us gonna tell him	
who's going to tell whom about what	
sheldon hey hi	
your surprise confuses me I live here	
right so, listen, what are you doing tomorrow afternoon	
be more specific that's not afternoon that's preevning	
what	
it's a time of day i invented it better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening preevning	
i'm fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need	
right, okay what are you doing tomorrow preevning	
well, tomorrow's saturday saturday night is laundry night so i'll be spending the preevning presorting and presoaking	
okay, what if i	
were to tell you, tomorrow, at, you could meet a woman who has been scientifically chosen to be your perfect mate	
i would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air, exhausted by your constant tomfoolery	
but it's true	
but wewe put all your vital information into this dating site, answered all their questions just like you would, and they found a match for you her name is amy farrah fowler	
please even assuming you could answer any question the way i would, the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum	
and that's exactly the answer we gave to the question "what is your attitude towards online dating"	
howard wanted to write "mumbo jumbo," but i said no our sheldon would say "hokum"	
come on, where's your scientific curiosity	
well, most of it is being applied to unraveling the secrets of the universe while the rest of it's wondering why i'm having this conversation with you	
okay, how about this even spock had a date once every seven years	
he didn't date it was pon farr	
his blood boiled with mating lust	
well, why don't you start with a cup of coffee, and you can pon farr amy farrah fowler later	
i don't drink coffee	
all right, you can have a hot chocolate	
as i will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is moot but for the record, i only drink hot chocolate in months with an "r" in them	
why	
what's life without whimsy	
okay, i'm out	
sheldon, i've hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl, it will remain there forever	
you're bluffing	
are you willing to risk it	
curse you	
feet	
oh hey, leonard	
i was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy, and you ruined me	
are you drunk	
come on we're gonna have sex,	
and it's not gonna mean a thing	
are you out of your mind	
i'm really starting to think there's a double standard here	
in a few minutes, when i gloat over the failure of this enterprise, how would you prefer i do it the standard "i told you so" the classic "neenerneener” or just my normal look of haughty derision	
you don't know we're wrong yet	
haughty derision it is	
excuse me i'm amy farrah fowler you're sheldon cooper	
hello, amy farrah fowler	
i'm sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely additionally, i'm being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock	
if that was slang, i'm unfamiliar with it if it was literal, i share your aversion to soiled hosiery in any case, i'm here because my mother and i have agreed that i will date at least once a year	
interesting my mother and i have the same agreement about church	
i don't object to the concept of a deity, but i'm baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance	
well, then you might want to avoid east texas	
noted now, before this goes any further, you should know that all forms of physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table	
may i buy you a beverage	
tepid water, please	
good god, what have we done
