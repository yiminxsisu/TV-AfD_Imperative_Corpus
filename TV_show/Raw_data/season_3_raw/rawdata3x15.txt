yeah, i miss you, too, sweetie	
listen, i got to go,	
but i'll see you tonight okay byebye	
no, you hang up first	
hello	
dude, i'm glad you finally got a girlfriend, but do you have to do all that loveydovey stuff in front of those of us who don't	
actually, he might have to there's an economic concept	known as a positional good in which an object is only valued by the possessor because it's not possessed by others the term was coined in by economist fred hirsch to replace the more colloquial, but less precise "neenerneener"	
that's not true	
my happiness is not dependent on my best friend being miserable and alone	
thank you	
although, i'd be lying if i said it wasn't a little bit of a perk	
who's miserable and alone	
me	
oh	
i used to be like that	then i got a girlfriend	in pre terms, neenerneener	
hey, what are you and bernadette doing for your first valentine's day yeah, i am pulling out all the stops there's a $ lover's	special at pf chang's egg rolls, dumplings, bottomless wok, and you get your picture taken on the big marble horse out front	
given that saint valentine was a third century roman priest who was stoned and beheaded, wouldn't a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one's steady gal to witness a brutal murder	
i understand your point, but given a choice, jews always go with chinese food	
well, if anyone's interested, i'll be spending this valentine's day the same way i spend every valentine's day	buying a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket, taking it home, standing over the sink and eating it out of the package with my bare hands like an animal	
okay, so to sum up one giant marble horse, one asinine comment,	one lonely man and his chicken and let's see who's left	oh, that's right my plans	
isn't anyone going to ask	
fine, tell us you're going to have sex with penny	
that's not what i was going to tell you	
it's okay i don't mind hearing about your sex life it's his that bugs me	
guess who the university is sending to switzerland to attend a conference and see the cern supercollider on february	
professor norton, although, god knows why he hasn't published anything of note since he won that nobel prize	
actually, professor norton can't make it he threw his back out rock climbing	
i heard he threw his back out climbing on his new girlfriend	
the bigboobed weather girl on channel	
that's the one in any case, they're asking me to fill in for him in switzerland or with the bigboobed weather girl	
switzerland and i get to bring a guest	
oh, man no way, dude this is incredible	i'm so happy, i'm not even going to question their judgment in picking you i'm just going to run home and start packing why wouldn't you take penny	
i am taking penny	
oh well, then i anticipate an awkward situation when you get home	
sheldon, you got a minute	
of course, my good friend	
come in	
help me out	
which ski hat says aprã¨s supercollider	
sheldon, i'm not taking you to switzerland	
well, of course you are	who else would you take	
penny	
what that's absurd penny has no interest in subatomic particle research	
yes, but it'll be valentine's day we can go sightseeing and skiing and make love in front of a roaring fire in the shadow of the snowcapped alps	
but penny has no interest in subatomic particle research	
i'm sorry, sheldon	
sorry i've been dreaming about going to the large hadron collider since i was nine years old	
yeah, well, i've been dreaming about spending valentine's day with a girl since i was six	
shame on you that's no dream for a scientist	
okay, what's the big surprise	
just a minute	
this tray contains clues as to what you and i are going	to be doing on valentine's day	
oh wow okay let's see	
we've got, uh, milk chocolate,	swiss cheese, fondue my lactoseintolerant boyfriend is going to eat all this then i'm going to climb on his back and rocket to the moon	
no but it does involve air travel	
okay, um let me slice this swiss cheese	with my swiss army knife, and then you can wash it down with a cup of swiss miss instant cocoa	
okay, i'm starting to think swiss is key here	
uhhuh	
we're going to disneyland and ride the matterhorn	
how does that involve air travel	
we're going to disney world and	ride the matterhorn	
no	
okay, sweetie, this started out fun, but i'm over it	
we're going to switzerland to see the cern supercollider and ski we'll also go skiing	
we're going skiing in switzerland	
well, you'll ski, i'll fall, but, yeah,	
we will be in switzerland for valentine's day oh, my god, leonard that's incredible	
sheldon not so fast	
you might want to hold off on lighting your rabeliechtli, penny	
rabewhatly	
rabeliechtli it means turnip light and refers to a traditional lantern handcarved from a root vegetable and used to celebrate certain swiss festivals which you will not be celebrating because a these festivals occur in the fall and b you will not be going to switzerland	
sheldon, we've been through this i'm taking penny	
afraid not do you recognize this	
not the roommate agreement	
indeed, the roommate agreement	
i call your attention to the friendship rider	
in appendix c future commitments "number  in the event one friend is ever invited "to visit the large hadron collider, "now under construction in switzerland,	he shall invite the other friend to accompany him"	
oh, for god's sakes you actually put that in an agreement	
yeah we also put in what happens if one of us wins a macarthur grant, or if one of us gets superpowers,	or if one of us is bitten by a zombie he can't kill me, even if i turn	
is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend	
no, that seemed a little farfetched	
sheldon, do you really expect to enforce this	
i've lived up to all my commitments under the agreement at least once a day i ask how you are, even though i simply don't care i no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after  pm	and i abandoned my goal to master tuvan throat singing	
okay, i know i shouldn't ask, but what is no	
i'd be much further along if i'd been allowed to practice	
look, sheldon,	i know it's in the agreement, and if you turn into a zombie, i promise i will not kill you in fact, i'll even let you eat my brains but i am taking penny to switzerland	
is that your final decision	
it is	
very well	
it's not over, is it	
what do you think	
got a bit of traffic this morning, huh	
think it's gonna rain	
instead of underpants,	i covered my crotch with potato salad this morning thoughts	
okay, i know what'll cheer you up	
let's play one of your driving games	
all right this game is called traitors	
i will name three historical figures,	
you put them in order	
of the heinousness of their betrayal benedict arnold, judas, dr	leonard hofstadter	
you really think i belong with benedict arnold and judas	
you're right judas had the decency to hang himself after what he did	
come on, sheldon	
can't you at least try to understand how much this means to me	
round two leonard hofstadter,darth vader, rupert murdoch	
rupert murdoch	
he owns fox, and they cancelled firefly hint he and darth vader are tied for #	
i'm sorry i couldn't hang with you last night i had a date with bernadette	
i know	i saw the tweet	
so, what did you end up doing	
not much nuked a burrito oh prayed to the hindu god urvashi that your bowels would loosen and your penis would droop like a willow tree	
you seen sheldon	
no is he still mad about the supercollider	
yeah he thinks i betrayed him	
i mean, come on	what would you guys do if you were me	
i'd take sheldon to switzerland	
seriously	
absolutely	
and i'd leave him there	
what the hell is that	
uh, let's see yup,  pieces of silverware	
morning, old chum what's going on	
i've made you breakfast	juice, coffee, and pancakes in the shape of some of your favorite fictional characters see, here's frodo	
you made frodo pancakes	
yeah, i used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet if you need to void your bladder before eating, i can keep them warm with this beret that i thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cozy	
why are you doing this	
it's by way of an apology for my recent behavior i've had some time to reflect and i've come to realize	that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements it's a result of two people respecting and caring for each other butterscotch scone	
thanks	
it's good	
what you're tasting is respect and affection and about a pound of crisco after you've finished breakfast,	
i thought we could spend the day watching the final season of babylon 5	with director commentary	
you hate babylon	
i do it fails as drama/science fiction,	and it's hopelessly derivative	but you like it, and you're my friend	
okay, great still not taking you to switzerland	
drat no frodo for you	
hello i believe you know why i'm here	
well, i always figured it was to study us, discover our weaknesses, and report back to your alien overlords	
extraordinary intelligence might well appear extraterrestrial to you, but let me be more specific i believe you know why i'm here in the laundry room	
better acoustics for your throat singing	
it's actually not bad but my true purpose in being here will be revealed in this brief	powerpoint presentation	
lights	
why sheldon cooper, phd, should go to switzerland to see the cern supercollider	a powerpoint presentation by sheldon cooper, phd	
oh, for god's sake	
here we have a highly gifted researcher	in the field of particle physics whose work has brought him to the precipice of forever changing mankind's understanding of the universe aka me	and here we have a waitress brushing her teeth with her finger aka you	
i'm sorry is this supposed to be buttering me up	
this is the large hadron collider at cern in switzerland, the product of decades of planning and construction it is a mecca for physicists the world over this is bath and body works on colorado boulevard they sell scented soaps and lotions, some of which contain glitter now, let's see if we can match the individual to the appropriate destination	
o kay	
show's over	
no, it's not i've got five more slides	
sheldon, this is leonard's decision he invited me to switzerland, and i intend to go	
very well	
enjoy yourself	
you're going to be in the presence of something that i've dreamed of seeing for decades i just hope you'll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents	
i'll talk to leonard	
you will	
yes	
if it means that much to you, you should go	
oh, penny, thank you	
you're welcome	
since i rarely hug, i'm relying on your expertise regarding duration	
i think we're there	
byebye	
you know what even though i don't have a girlfriend, i can still have a good time on valentine's day	
trust me, you can't i've tried	
no, no, no, i'm going to have a "me" day first i'm going to go to one of those spas in koreatown, take a steam and get a massage then i'm going to stop at a pet store and get licked by puppies	
sheldon, i need to talk to you	
all right, my friend would you like some cholermus	
some what cholermus	
it's a traditional swiss breakfast dish i'm preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of switzerland	
you're not going to switzerland	
oh, but i am didn't penny tell you the good news	
she told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her	
yes, that good news	
well, forget it	
i was the one who was invited i get to decide who goes with me,	and it's penny, not you	
howard, could you lower the lights	
i have a short powerpoint presentation	
i don't need to see your presentation	
this discussion is over	
that's a somewhat ambiguous response am i going or not	
sheldon, at this point,	i would go by myself before i would take you	
really	
yeah, really	
from this moment forward, we can be roommates, but we will no longer be friends	
i'm sorry you feel that way i don't think you're fully aware of the ramifications here,	
why don't you enlighten me	
with the friendship clause of our roommate agreement nullified you are no longer entitled to accompany me to go swimming at bill gates'	house should i be invited	
ooh, that's gotta sting	
just think, this time tomorrow	
we'll be in geneva, switzerland	for our first valentine's day	
i know	i went shopping today	and bought special undies for the occasion	
thermal 'cause it's gonna be cold	
think it through, leonard	
oh oh	
gesundheit or as they say in switzerland, gesundheit	
you getting a cold	
no, no, it's probably just allergies	
do you want an allergy pill 'cause i have 'em all prescription, nonprescription,	foreign, domestic, experimental	
do any of them work	
penny you okay	
did that sound okay to you	
do not come in here	
what's going on	
i'm having a tea party what do you think's going on i think i might have the flu or the plague	
well, our plane leaves at  am do you think you'll feel better by then	
yep 'cause i'm gonna be dead	
hey, sheldon	
listen, penny is pretty sick	
and she's not going to be able to go to switzerland	
so if you're still interested,	you're welcome to come	
great i'll start packing	
in a minute	
oh, look, it's the cholermus	
here's your soup	
chicken yes	
with the little stars yes	
heated to  degrees	
you don't have to be mean	
i'm sick	
yeah, well, i'm sick, too	
not my problem	
i just don't understand	how this happened to me	i'm scrupulous about my hygiene i regularly disinfect my hands,	and i avoid contact with other people on general principle	
i don't know what to tell you, sheldon	
oh, penny, thank you	
(in slow motion) you're welcome	
it's you i touched you	
happy valentine's day	
oh, my goodness, look at this room	
champagne roses oh and little chocolates

but i never will
