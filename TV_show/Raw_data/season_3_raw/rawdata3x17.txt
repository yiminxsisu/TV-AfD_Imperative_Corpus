why do i always have to carry the heavy stuff	
well, it's very simple in our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose, i'm the smart one, wolowitz is the funny one, and koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails that leaves you, default, as the muscle	
oh	
one more floor, and i'd be the pulled muscle	
oh, it's about time i'm starving	
um, well, we didn't get chinese food	
why not	
don't panic	
this is better	
oh, no you didn't trade the food	 for magic beans, did you	
of course not	
and technically magic beans would be food although eating them would be quite a waste, since you could plant them, and overnight, have a giant beanstalk, which would provide enough roughage for a small city	
yeah, sometimes i don't listen sometimes i just watch jaw go up and down	
we were on our way to the chinese restaurant when we thought we saw adam west, so we followed him	
who's adam west	
who's adam west	
leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus	
my guess is, "hey, four minutes new record" that's why i'm the funny one	
anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale, and they had the coolest stuff they were closing up we got this whole box for  bucks	
we didn't even get to go through it all there could be anything in here	
there a new girlfriend in there 'cause you might need one	
no	
but there is an original final draft ghostbusters script with actual	 slime stains	
oh, you're right	
it's ghostbusters	
never mind	
oh, my God an alf doll when i was , my mother got me one to help me sleep after my dad left i used to pretend that my dad had moved to the planet melmac, and alf was going to bring him back to me but he never did where's my daddy, puppet where is he	
that is so sad	
no, what's sad is that you don't know adam west was tv's batman	
here's spock's head with no body	
here's mr t's body with no head	
oh, yeah, here's spock's body with mr t's head	
i pity the fool who's illogical	
okay, i'm just gonna go home and make a grilled cheese and windowshop on eharmony	
okay, bye	
okay	
ooh, look, an indiana jones connectthedots and an aquaman action figure	
looks like someone drew a penis on him	
ooh, that'll come off	
you see what you're doing	
stop that	
fascinating	
what	
it appears to be a lord of the rings ring	
oh	
it's even got the elvish engraving on it	
it's not elvish	
it's the language of mordor written in elvish script	
"one ring torule them all"	
"one ring to find them"	
"one ring to bring them all"	
"and in the darkness bind them"	
holy crap, are we nerdy	
so, i was doing some checking on the ring	
hold on	
sheldon, is there ketchup on that table	
yes, there is	
oh, here's a fun fact ketchup started out	 as a general term for sauce, typically made of mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices some popular early main ingredients included blueberry, anchovy, oyster, kidney bean and grape	
no, that's okay i'll get it	
listen, i was looking at that ring	
and it seemed a little weird no copyright notice on it so, i took it down to this buddy of mine who deals with shall we say the seedy underbelly of the collectibles world seedy underbelly you know, your black market phasers, your screenworn lieutenant uhura panties, that kind of stuff	
who's this mysterious buddy you suddenly have	
just a guy i know a guy	
is it eddie crispo	
no, i can't tell you who it is	
stop asking	
who else could it be it has to be eddie crispo	
i know lots of dangerous people, okay	
name one	
eddie crispo	
anyway, he said this isn't a replica it's the real deal	
if you're suggesting that	 that is the actual ring of power	forged by sauron in mount do i look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement	
he's not saying it's a magic ring	
you're not, are you	
no, but it's close	
look at the markings inside	
those are production markings nine rings were made for use in the lord of the rings movies	three were given to members of the cast the rest were destroyedexcept one one was stolen	gentlemen this is the one ring	
mine	
no, it is not yours	
we all went in on the box together	
well, yes, but I found it in the box, and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure is the owner of the treasure	
how is this maritime salvage	
other than the lack of water, how is it not	
wait, wait	
Sheldon, stop being crazy for a second	
how much is something like this worth	
well, it's tough to say since it's hot, but on the underground market, my guy figures	
your guy eddie crispos	
he figures ten, maybe  thousand	
okay, that's a lot of money	
the wise thing to do is invest it in something practical like a jet ski	
why do you want a jet ski	
all the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride jet skis that can't just	 a coincidence	
we can't sell it	
we have to keep it and love it and polish it,	
and only take it out occasionally	 when we go to the park and reenact our favorite scenes from the movies	
it's sad how great that sounds	
guys, it's stolen	it should go back to peter jackson	
he made the movies it belongs to him	
fine he can have it back	as long as he promises to make me a hobbit in his next movie	
there are no jewish hobbits	
clearly, you've never been to my house for dinner	
on rosh hashanah	
we are not blackmailing peter j	
all right, where's the ring	
you mean my ring	
what are you doing the ring was unguarded it was just sitting on the table anyone could have taken it	
proof i did	
give me that	
look, let's be reasonable	
we all want to do different things with the ring, but your ideas are stupid, and i want a jet ski	
i found it the ring is mine	
i don't understand why in this group I never get my way	
you always get your way	
i'll stipulate to that if you give me the ring	
hey, guys enjoying your food that i actually brought you instead of promising food, but bringing you a box of random crap	
yeah, it's delicious	
the sarcasm's a little stale, though	
hey, how about this until we figure out what to do with the ring, penny holds on to it	
what ring	
this ring	
looking for something	
will you hold on to this for a couple of days	
why	
it's a prop from a movie, and we're kind of fighting over it	
okay, just to be clear, the first piece of jewelry my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie, and i don't even get to keep it	
if you had gone out with me three years ago, by now, you'd have my great aunt ida's brooch	that she smuggled out of occupied belgium in a cat how am i looking now	
ow	
oh	
you hit me i'm bleeding	
what was that	
sheldon tried to take the ring and i punched him	
that's my girl	
so, sheldon, how's it feel to get beaten up by a girl	
it's not the first time	
i have a twin sister whose assaults began in utero if only i'd had the presence of mind to reabsorb her, then i'd have a mole with hair in it instead of a tedious yearly Christmas letter	
gentlemen, have you come to the realization that the only reasonable course of action is to sell the ring	 and divide the money	
no	
i was afraid of that	
go ahead	
greetings from Mumbai i am raj's attorney, venkatesh koothrappali	
also my cousin	
you brought a lawyer	
don't answer that	
i'll get straight to the point my client's prepared to surrender any interest he has in the ring in exchange for two kawasaki jet skis	
we're not giving him two jet skis	
look, we're big boys,	
why don't we just cut to the chase and meet in the middle	
one kawasaki jet ski	
done and done	
no jet skis	
all right, forget the jet skis	
forget the jet skis	
that was our line in the sand what happened to "tear them a new one"	
what can i say they played hardball we lost	
you're useless	
i told you that when you hired me	
i'm signing off now	
call your mother	
she worries	
okay, just so you know, if we're bringing in cousins who are lawyers,	
prepare for shock and awe	
you know what i am ending this penny didn't want to hold the ring anymore she gave it to me	
i have it	
i'm sending it back	
where's the ring	
you mean this ring	
next time be aware of your surroundings	while urinating	in a public men's room	
give me that	
no, it's mine	
it's all of ours	
okay, now, this is ridiculous	
then let go	
i'm not letting go	
you let go	
i say this ring belongs to the last person who can hold on	
fine but can't we go home and start this	
sure let go of the ring	
all right, it starts now	
you do realize there's a giant bug movie marathon tonight on the syfy channel	
wait, my laptop	
you know, there's a point when this becomes idiotic and it wasn't when we were driving like this	
i would advise the three of you	that resistance	is futile	
i have endless patience i once spent twoandahalf hours on hold with hewlettpackard customer service just to complain about their customer service	
you want to talk about endless patience penny made me watch all five seasons of sex and the city	
there are six seasons, dude	
oh, crap	
no, no, no, the sixth season is great we go to paris with carrie and get our heart broken, and then mr big shows up, we don't know if we can trust him again it's a wild ride	
door	
okay, everybody, and plié and relevé	
whatcha doin'	
last one holding the ring decides its fate	
i know, it sounds silly	
no, no, no, no, no,	
you are my boyfriend nothing you do is silly to me	
thank you	
fyi this is a bag from victoria's secret	
i'm out	
i'm sorry, ma, i have to stay late at the office	
no, he's doesn't he's lying to you	
will you be quiet	
well, if you want privacy	
let go of the ring	
i'm so glad we came to this gentile strip club	
howard, here's more bacon to tuck into the shiksa's gstring	
i'll call you back	
i think it's lovely you call your mommy and let her know you're going to be late for dinner from what i know about these things, if a woman doesn't breastfeed on time,it's very uncomfortable for her boobies	
don't you talk about my mother's boobies	
if you're offended,	
let go of the ring and go on home to your mother's boobies	
excellent, excellent	
tire each other out,	
the ring will be mine	
howard, why don't you go after raj's mother	
why don't we go	after your mother	
go ahead	
i have no illusions about my mother she is a kind, loving,	 religiously fanatical rightwing Texan with a slightly outofscale head and a mild dr pepper addiction	
anything you'd like to add	
that's not gonna get you anywhere better pull out the big gun	
you're right	
let's talk about your grandmother	
no	
i call no meemaws	
think about this	
the only way your mother was born was your meemaw had sex	
i don't want to hear this	
then let go of the ring	and walk away	
never	
all right	
i'll bet your meemaw didn't just have sex to have your mother i bet she had sex because she liked it	
stop it	
yeah, meemaw did the nasty	
i said stop it	
we're getting to him	
waterfalls	
what	
waterfalls crashing waves babbling brooks	
what are you doing	
subliminal messaging i'm going to make you want to pee dripping faucets leaky gutter peeing	
it's, it's not working, dude	
ohhoho,	
it's working all right i have to pee	
then let go of the ring and go	
no, actually, i wouldn't mind going, too	
fine um, on the count of three	
one, two	
wait, just to clarify when you get to three, do we stand up or do we pee	
we stand up	
excellent choice	
three	
something tells me this was a bad day to wear suede shoes	
i've done it i've won the ring is mine it's mine	
we're going to clean it up and make it pretty	
my own my love my precious	
where's the ring	
it's in a fedex box on its way back to where it came from	
the fires of mount doom	
peter jackson's office in new Zealand it wasn't ours	
you quit the game you had no right to take it	
i came in here, you guys were all sleeping the ring was on the floor no one was touching it	
well, so then we start the game	over until there's a winner	
there wasn't ever going to be a winner there was going to be a selfish, petty person with a ring and three people who used to be his friend is that really what you guys want 'cause if it is, fine i don't want anything to do with you and i don't know what happened in that bathroom, but i am not cleaning it up	
my precious	
i knew it	
give us	the precious	
give me give me	
get off of me
