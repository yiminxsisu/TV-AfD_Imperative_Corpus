all right, raj has played his phantom warlord card,	
and i am going to back him up with my strangling vines	
choke on that, sucka	
okay, well, then i'll just cut your vines with my ruby sword	
that's right, i did it i cut 'em	
um	
i have a question	
warlord beats troll, troll beats elf,	
elf beats water sprite,	
and basically everything beats enchanted bunny	
unless you have the carrot power	
okay, i've got another question	
when does this get fun	
are we going to talk	
or are we going to play	
"mystic warriors of kaah"	
just play potion card	
which one	
it doesn't matter	
you can't possibly win	
sheldon, don't ruin the game	
how could he ruin the game	
given the cards that have	
already been played,	
penny can only be holding necromancer potions,	
which are only effective against wraiths and daywalkers,	
and there are no more of either left to be drawn	
the cards remaining in the undrawn stack are four fire weapons, a troll, two ogres and the jewel of osiris	
see ruined	
sheldon, that is incredible	
from your vantage point,	
it certainly must seem so	
sheldon has kind of	
a photographic memory	
"photographic" is a misnomer	
i have an eidetic memory,	
as i've told you many times	
most recently last year during lunch on the afternoon of may seventh	
you had turkey and complained it was dry	
well, i guess game'over	
really oh, great	
i mean, aw	
okay, i gotta go	
why	
because the last me i didn't go,	
i ended up playing "mystic warlords of ka"	
not "ka kaah"	
buheye	
see ya	
still can't believe	
she's going out with me	
nobody can	
that reminds me, i have	a bone to pick with you	
what	
you and i made a pact	
that if either of us ever got a hot girlfriend,	
that person would have his girlfriend hook the other guy up with one of her girlfriends	
i don't remember that	
june th,	
opening day of spiderman at the amc pasadena	
they only had red icees, no blue	
oh, yeah	
so you've been with penny for like a month and a half now	
where's my shorty, morty	
howard, you can't hold me to that	
why not	
because when i made that agreement,	
i didn't think i'd ever have a hot girlfriend	
and i was positive you never would	
hey, how come i wasn't part of this deal	
you had left the refreshment stand in order to indulge in your customary preemptive preshow urination	
oh, so that's how it works	
i have a teeny bladder and now	
i don't get a hot girlfriend	
yeah, raj that's how it works	
damn	
oh, damn it can i have a napkin	
i'm sorry, no	
but you have a whole bunch of 'em	
yes, i've moved to a fournapkin system	
lap, hands, face and personal emergencies	
if you like, starting tomorrow,	
i'll add a guest napkin,	
but i'm afraid there's nothing i can do for you today	
good luck that's the face napkin	
so, have you talked to penny yet	
no, i haven't	
why not	
because i've been busy,	
because i haven't figured out a way to bring it up,	
and mostly and i can't stress how key this is	
because i don't want to	
leonard, a pact is a pact	
you have to get penny to fix me up	
it's not that simple	
what am i supposed to say	
"penny, do you have any friends you'd like to never hear from again"	
come on, i'm smart,	
i have good job and i have only three percent body fat	
it's true	
i've seen him at the beach	
he's like a human chicken wing	
leonard, come on	
fine i'll ask if she has a friend for you	
hot friend	
right	
and tall	
i want our kids to be able to ride space mountain before they're	
ii'll see what i can do	
hey, sheldon, guess what i heard today	
i'd imagine you heard any number of things today	
when you arrived at work you undoubtedly heard, "hello, raj"	
"how are you, raj"	
given that you're wearing a new sweatervest,	
you may have heard "new sweatervest"	
and possibly, though far less likely, "nice sweatervest"	
why don't i just tell you what i heard today	
that would probably save us some time	
saturday night at the comic book store,	
they're having a "mystic warlords of kaah" tournament	
first prize is $	
if we team up, we'd be unstoppable	
i'm sorry, raj, but i have no interest	
in playing a game in which i find no challenge	
what about the money	
i have money	
this is other money	
how does it different from the money i have	
half of it will be mine	
do you need it to buy a less	
disturbing sweatervest	
leonard, help	
are you kidding	
i couldn't even talk him into giving one of his freakin' napkins	
wow, you really are a genius	
not really	
i googled how to do that	
so, listen have you ever made a pact with someone	
okay, fine, like a pinky swear	
well, in the first grade,	
my friend rosie and i made a pact to marry bert and ernie	
you know, from sesame street	
i'm familiar with bert and ernie	
knowing fact, we both wanted ernie	
we didn't speak again until middle school over puppets	
the heart wants what	
the heart wants, leonard	
okay	
speaking of what the heart wants	
um, a long time ago,	
i made a pact with wolowitz	
that kind of involves you	
okay, i don't know where you're going with this,	
but tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have	
no, no, nothing like that	
the deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend,	
we'd have her fix the other one up with one of her friends	
and you thought a good time to bring this up be right after sex	
well, i sure as hell wasn't gonna bring it up before sex	
and during, i was trying to remember what i read on google, so	
i'm not hooking wolowitz up with one of my friends	
it doesn't have to be a good friend	
and you know that deep down	
inside, howard's a really nice guy	
the problem isn't what's on the inside	
it's the creepy candy coating	
will you at least think about it	
just as a favor to me	
oh, great thing about ernie,	
was he never asked me for anything	
he just gave	
got it got it got it	
got it got it got it	
betty and veronica	
oh	
hey, sheldon, the new green lantern figurine's coming in tomorrow	
want me to set one aside for you	
thank you	
you just robbed me of the opportunity to stumb upon the figurine	
and make the ohsosatisfying journey from discovery to desire to possession	
all right, i won't set one aside for you	
but i must have it	
okay, i'll set one aside for you	
thank you	
you know, i can buy all these things online	
i come here for the personal service	
hey, stuart, is the wil wheaton signed up for the mystic warlords tournament	
the wil wheaton from star trek	
yeah, he lives around here big gamer	
excuse me	
are you saying that wil wheaton	
aka ensign wesley crusher	
on star trek the next generation is going to be participating in your tournament	
oh, i'm sorry, did i rob you of the opportunity	to stumble onto that for yourself	
you don't understand	
growing up, i idolized wil wheaton	
wesley crusher had an eidetic	
memory just like me	
ooh, what a coincidence	
meanwhile you're playing in the tournament	
sign here	
i was such a fan	
that in , i traveled ten hours by bus	
to a scifi convention in jackson, mississippi,	
wearing my star flee academy cadet uniform	
in order to meet wil wheaton and get him to autograph my mint inpackage wesley crusher action figure	
ooh, it'll be like a reunion then	
sign here	
my arduous journey, however,	
was for naught	
although advertised to appear,	
he did not show up	
it was at that moment, i vowed	
eternal hatred for wil wheaton	
okay, great, you can	
tell him you hate him	
sign here	
it might also interest you to know that wil wheaton currently ranks sixth on my atime enemies list	
right between director joel schumacher,	
who nearly destroyed the batman movie franchise,	
and billy sparks, who lived down the street from me and put dog poop on the handles of my bicycle	
okay, i get it he's a bad guy	
sign here	
in the words of khan noonn singh	
in the immortal wrath ofhan, "he tasks me	
he tasks me and i shall have him"	
no doubt,	
sign here	
from hell's heart, i stab at thee"	
all right, raj, looks	
like you're teamed up	
with "die, wil wheaton, die"	
so, tell me more about the future mother of my children	
she's adorable, howard	
i think you'll like her	
great	
so what did you tell her about me	
did you mention the body fat	
no, i thought that would be a nice surprise for her	
good, good	
i just told her you're an aerospace engineer,	
you speak five languages	
six if you count klingon	
girls don't count klingon, howard	
right	
right	
oh and i told her you have	
an unhealthy attachment to your mother	
what	
i'm kidding	
another delightful surprise for her	
sheldon, it's your play	
sheldon	
my enchanted troll bludgeons	
your screaming harpy with a cursed mace game	
sorry, boys	
say hi to your mother	
when she picks you up	
or i could just tell her later tonight	
we pawned them, dude up top	
look at him	
wil wheaton, my old friend	
i have chased you 'round the moons of nibia	
and 'round the antares maelstrom	
and 'round perdition's flames	
you know, you keep quoting wrath of khan,	
but he was in next generation	
it's a totally different set of characters	
silence	
how much longer must i wait for my revenge	
well, if wil wheaton and stuart win their match	
and we beat lonely larry and captain sweatpants	in the next round,	
we'll face off for the championship	
so, my path to satisfaction is blocked by lonely larry and captain sweatpants	
very well	
they must be destroyed	
dude, you have to stop talking like that	
it's really lame	
silence	
so, penny tells me you're working as a waitress to put yourself through grad school	
that's pretty great	
what are you studying	
microbiology	
oh, cool so you could study me	
i don't understand	
microbiology is the study of tiny living things	
i know, i'm studying it	
and i said you could study me	
'cause i'm a tiny living thing	
it's a joke	
are you sure	
do you like sciencefiction	
no	
roleplaying games	
like in the bedroom or	
like dungeons and dragons	
either	
no	
gonna be a long night	
well, it's your fault	
i had to ask you didn't have to say yes	
you like magic	
not really	
okay	
i play my endless serpent	
raj will play ecstatic frenzy,	
which means larry will have to play chaos overlord	
then captain sweatpants, molten river	
i play nightshade dryad	
game, set and match	
now fetch me wil wheaton	
bottash bir jabloodi rekh kkhakkho ny	
did that guy just say	
"revenge is a dish best	served cold" in klingon	
i believe so	
what is wrong with him	
everyone has a different theory	
how about computers	
do you like computers	
i use them i don't like them	
okay	
puppies where do you stand on puppies	
a puppy once bit my face	
of course it did	
how about that einstein was wrong	
what	
approaching the speed of light doesn't slow down time	
approaching them does	
excuse me	
oh, damn it's my mother	
are you going to answer it	
i'm torn	
she might be dying, and, you know,	
i wouldn't want to miss that	
on the other hand,	
if i let it go to voicemail,	
i could play it over and over	
i know how you feel	
my mother makes me crazy	
not as crazy as my mother makes me	
oh, yeah	
does your mother call you every day at work	
to see if you've had a healthy lunch	
my mother calls me at workk	
to see if i had a healthy bowel movement	
okay, well, does she lay out your clothes for you in the morning	
like you're nine years old	
you live with your mother	
no that's the sad part	
ooh, rough	
okay, check this out	
my mother made me wear	
rubber gloves to kindergarten	
so i wouldn't pick up a disease	from the other children	
that's nothing	
i couldn't ride a bicycle	
'cause my mother was afraid i'd hit a bump	
and lose my virginity	
oh, wow	
you didn't, did you	
not on a bicyclle	
in a camry	
oh	
corolla	
more wine	
i'd love some	
listen, you have to come to shabbat dinner at my house sometime	
why	
a catholic girl like you	
wearing a big cross like that	
might just give my mother	
the big brain aneurysm i've been hoping for	
okay, but only if you come to sunday dinner at my house wearing a yarmulke	
it's a date	
am i a matchmaker or what	
lava serpent	
nest of snakes	
underworld guardian	
underworld guardian	
we skirmish to the death	
invisibility spell	
luminescence spell	
water nymph	
fire demon	
twoaded tiger	
threeheaded lion	
sulphur	
brimstone	
problem, wil wheaton	
hang on	
you're holding two moderate spell cards,	
a small rock and a potion of zancor,	
which will be about as much help	
as an air conditioner	
on the ice planet hoth	
your only move is to play the potion, lose the skirmish,	
and two moves later, the game	
i think he's got me	
the year was	
the place jackson, mississippi	
having spent ten hours on a bus,	
during which i had to twice violate	
my personal rule against relieving myself on board a moving vehicle	
i finally arrived	
at the fourth annual	
dixietrek convention	
only to find that my idol	
wil wheaton decided he had better things to do than to show up and sign my action figure	
what	
you betrayed me, wil wheaton	
you went to the ' dixietrek	
oh, dude, my grandmother had just died,	
and i had to go to her funeral	
your meemaw died	
that's terrible	
yeah, it was	
but i'm really sorry	
that i disappointed you	
no, no, i understand	
anything happened to my meemaw,	
i'd be one inconsolable moon pie	
i should clarify that statement	
by explaining that she calls me "moon pie"	
it'a special relationship, isn't it,	
between a boy and his grandmother	
oh, yes	
okay, great, everybody	
loves their grandmas	
now, come on, sheldon, finish him off	
it's okay, sheldon	
i let you down	
i deserve it	
potion of zancor	
what are you waiting for	
kill wil wheaton	
from hell's heart, stab at him	
i can't	
sure you can do it do it	
no	
i came here to defeat wil wheaton,	
the man who destroyed my dreams	
but i can't defeat wil wheaton,	
the man who loved is meemaw	
enchanted bunny	
no not enchanted bunny	
i call my meemaw "nana"	
and she's going  be very happy to hear that my small rock kills your enchanted bunny	
game over, moon pie	
i i i don't understand	
your grandmother's alive	
oh, you catch on quick	
come on, stewie, let's get our prize money	
that was fun	
wheaton
