will you please turn your shirt off	
what i'm giving myself dramatic entrance music will know i'm awesome and to be feared	
right there's nothing more awesome and frightening than a man who's got music blasting from between his nipples	
hey, stuart what's going on	
well, you might want to mark your google calendars	
stan lee is coming to do a signing on thursday	
did he finally write a sequel to his autobiography i'm sure ages  through were just actionpacked	
no, just a regular comic signing my uncle is his dermatologist and stan's doing him a favor	
oh, i don't want to know that	
how can i possibly discuss with stan lee the scientific foundations for interstellar flight on a silver surfboard when part of my brain will be scanning his face for signs of contagious skin disease	
stan lee does not have  contagious skin disease	
well, look who thinks he's stuart's uncle now	
can't believe it we're going to meet stan lee	
i'm sad to say i taught him those moves	
i can't decide whether i want stan lee to autograph my journey into mystery, first appearance of thor or my fantastic four number five, first appearance of dr doom	
alex, i'm going to go with what is you're a dumbass	
i've decided i'm going to have mr lee sign my copy of this month's batman	
that's crazy	
stan lee had nothing to do with batman	
yes, which is why no one else will ask him to sign one, and i will be the possessor of a unique, albeit confusing, artifact, which will set me apart from hoi polloi of comic book fandom	
that's a great idea	
i'm going to get him to sign a batman as well	
what is it about the word	
"unique" you don't understand	
ow	
damn, paper cut	
nothing worse than a paper cut	
well, obviously you don't remember your circumcision	
there's neosporin and bandaids in my top desk drawer	
why don't you keep that stuff in the bathroom	
he does and in the kitchen and in the car and in his pocket	
yeah, but the ones in my pocket are mine	
hi	
hey	
guess who's going to be at the comic bookstore on thursday	
um can you give me a hint	
stan lee	
um Stanley stanley stanley tucci	
no no, stan lee	
oh, oh, stan lee cool	
you have no idea who he is, do you	
of course i do you're an important part of my life and i pay attention to the things you are interested in	
oh, good good so, who's stan lee	
um he was on star trek	
nope	
star wars	
no	
um uh, stan lee ooh, he was in those goofy kung fu movies you love so much	
that's bruce lee	
oh so, is this bruce lee's nerdy brother, stan	
sheldon, why do you have all these unopened paychecks in your desk	
because most of the things i'm planning to buy haven't been invented yet	
there there must be thousands of dollars here why don't you put it in the bank	
i don't trust banks i believe that when the robots rise up, atms will lead the charge	
you've also got something from the Pasadena municipal court	
undoubtedly another snide response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are flying in the wrong order from left to right, it's supposed to be federal, state, and then city of pasadena	
i'm sorry you sent more than one letter about that	
it bothers me sheldon, this is a summons	
a summons for what	
looks like you ran a red light on marengo avenue at  pm on November they got you on a traffic camera	
nice picture	
november penny, that's the evening you fell in your bathtub and i had to drive you to the emergency room	
no, it isn't	
yes, it is	
no, it isn't	
penny, i have an eidetic memory also, that's a picture of you in the passenger seat holding your dislocated shoulder	
mmm, no, it isn't	
okay, then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car, bearing your license plates, coming to me	
okay, look, they sent me the ticket i told them i wasn't driving and they were all, "if it wasn't you, who was it"	
so you betrayed me	
no it wasn't a betrayal it was more of a "i can't afford any more points on my license" i already have to buy my insurance from this place in the cayman islands	
but the only reason i was driving your car was because you were in distress and i was rescuing you	
yes, yes, look, and now you have a photo to remember that heroic day	
it's not that big a deal	
you just go down to the court	
on thursday	
and you pay the fine	
i'm not going to pay a fine that would imply i'm guilty	
you are guilty	
that one i liked	
i am not guilty i only have a learner's permit penny was the teacher when the light turned yellow she said "go, go, go" so i went, went, went	
sheldon, i'm sorry i'll be happy to reimburse you for the fine you know, as soon as i get a part in a movie or my own tv series	
you don't need to reimburse me because i'm not paying	
on thursday, i will have my day in court and justice will be done in fact, i'm going to begin preparing my defense right now	
okay, he's going to jail	
oh, that's right thursday is stan lee day	
now you see what you've done because of you, we're all going to miss stan lee	
whoa	
what do you mean "all"	
well, you're my friends	
you'll be standing by my side, supporting me,	
feeding me legal precedents, and if you had the upper body strength,me out on your shoulders when i'm victorious	
yeah, okay no	
are you saying that you will not stand beside me as i plead my case	
that's what i'm saying	
howard	
wow	
uh, stan lee, or you in court	
uh, if this was sophie's choice it would've been a much shorter movie no	
raj	
you'll be there, won't you	
all right, then my socalled friends have forsaken me so, i guess it'll just be me and my eyewitness	
oh, balls	
please try to wear something appropriate	
it won't help my case if the judge is busy trying to read the word "juicy" across your buttocks	
penny penny penny	
that's just wrong	
all right, let's go	
wait, hold on	
before we get to the courthouse,	
i'd like to call on your skills as an actress	
what is this i've taken the liberty of scripting your appearance on the witness stand because, let's face it, you're somewhat of a loose cannon	
now, don't worry it's written	
in your vernacular	
so shall we rehearse	
do i have a choice	
well, of course you have a choice although we live in a deterministic universe, each individual has free will	
now, sit down	
i call your attention to the events of november 
do you remember that date	
"darn tootin', i do	
"if the court will excuse my homespun, cornfed Nebraskan turn of phrase"	
that's excellent, go on	
"the reason that date is, like, "so totally fixed in my memory "is that i had the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic acts i've ever seen in, like, ever"	
"and who performed that heroic act"	
"why, you did, sir "you dr sheldon cooper and may i add, it is a privilege to know you"	
"there's no need for compliments this court is only interested in the facts"	
"but it is a fact that it's a privilege to know you totally" a teardrop rolls down my cheek	
only a suggestion	
a catch in your throat would work just as well	
"but it is a fact "that it's a privilege to know you totally"	
maybe you should put on your "juicy" pants again	
pay the cashier	
sheldon coope good morning, your honor	
dr sheldon cooper appearing in pro se that is to say, representing himself	
i know what it means i went to law school	
and yet you wound up in traffic court	
anyway, if it would please the court, i'd like to begin with an opening statement	
the court would advise you to make it quick,	
as the court had a dicey looking breakfast burrito this morning and just took an imodium	
very well a quick opening statement like a milking stool, my case rests on three legs i will demonstrate that i was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic	
i will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum that which is necessary is legal but first, i will raise a sixth amendment issue i'm unable to confront my accuser, a nonhuman entity, to wit, a camera so, to sum up improper instruction quod est necessarium est licitum sixth amendment my milk stool is complete	
impressive	
thank you	
guilty	
pay the cashier	
i object you're completely ignoring the law	
no, i'm following the law i'm ignoring you	
really i would point out that i am at the top of my profession, while you preside over the kiddy table of yours	
dr cooper, before i find you in contempt and throw you in jail, i'm going to give you a chance to apologize for that last remark	
i am a scientist i never apologize for the truth	
that's my spot	
that start with the same letter	
oh, come on why would you do that	
bruce banner, reed richards, sue storm, stephen strange, otto octavius, silver surfer, peter parker, oh, and worst of all, j jonah jameson, jr	
okay, i'm cutting i'm not gonna talk to stan lee	
after you cheese him off	
hey	
sheldon's in jail	
sheldon's in jail	
you called it	
what do you think	
for what	
for doing the same crap he always does, except to a judge he has to stay in there until he apologizes	
so tell him to apologize	
oh, gee, thanks, leonard that didn't occur to me if he doesn't apologize by, he is going to spend the night in jail	
oh, no, that's terrible ooh, the line's moving got to go bye	
excuse me excuse me, jailor	
what	
i need to use the restroom	
knock yourself out	
that's the toilet	
well, it ain't a wishing well	
please tell the judge i'm ready to apologize	
look at that	
"to my friend, leonard from stan lee, excelsior"	
awesome	
mine says, "to my friend, howard from stan lee, excelsior"	
mine says, "to raj, from stan lee"	
that's 'cause you pissed him off about his character names	
hey, i didn't even mention dum dum dugan or green goblin, matt murdock, pepper potts, victor von doom, oh, and worst of all, millie the model	
we're home	
oh, hey, buddy how'd it go	
you know very well how it went	
yeah, but we all want to hear it from you	
i was found guilty and fined $	
i'm going to write you a check for that as long as you promise to put it in your drawer and never cash it, like the others	
i also now have three points on a driver's license i do not yet possess, and i was forced to issue an undeserved apology, simply because i refuse to urinate in a stainless steel bowl in front of criminals	
plus, you didn't get to meet stan lee	
okay, that's enough, howard the poor guy's had a tough time he had to spend the entire afternoon in jail wearing that suit	
you're right,	
so it would be cruel to mention that after he finished signing autographs, stanley took stuart and us out for gelato	
you had gelato with stan lee	
he said we could call him stan	
except for raj	
well, i hope you're satisfied, penny you are responsible all the evil that has befallen me today	
okay, i realize that	
not finished	
it is because of you that i now have a criminal record, and it is because of you that i missed out on having gelato with stan lee	
okay, maybe you'll have another chance to have	
no, no i will never have another chance to have gelato with stan lee because opportunities to gelato with stan lee come but once in a lifetime	
"the moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on"	
did he just somehow give me the finger	
not just the finger the moving finger	
hey, stuart	
oh, hey, penny	
wow hi	
what's going on	
nothing	
i'm just getting ready to close up and head out	
ah	
cool got any fun plans	
oh, yeah big night tonight share a can of tuna with the cat	
oh, nice	
not even my cat i just feed it some nights it doesn't even show up	
oh, okay	
well, i was hoping, um, you could do me a favor	
sure, yeah, name it	
well, i'm kind of responsible for sheldon missing stan lee, and i really want to make it up to him	
so i was hoping you could give me his phone number	
so maybe i can arrange for them to meet	
oh, i'm sorry, i don't have his phone number	
hmm damn	
mm	
all right thank you	
mmhmm	
wait	
i have his address	
really great	
but i can't give it to you	
then why did you tell me you had it	
i don't know just chatting	
you're looking at a guy who could very well get stood up by a stray cat tonight	
i'm sorry, stuart	
thanks anyway	
mmhmm	
wait	
yeah	
maybe we can make a deal	
what kind of deal	
i will give you the address if you go to my cousin's wedding with me	
you're extorting a date out of me	
i kind of have to the cousin who's getting married is the cousin i usually go to weddings with	
can i bring leonard	
sure what the hell	
deal	
we'll tell people he's your cousin	
this is stan lee's front door we were on stan lee's curb, then we were on stan lee's walk,and now we're at stan lee's front door	
yup	
oh, lord, you just rang stan lee's doorbell at stan lee's house	
we're about to go in and have milk and cookies with stan lee	
okay, sweetie, i don't know if we're gonna have cookies, or he's just gonna say hi, or really what's gonna happen, so just let me talk, and we'll	
yeah	
are you stan lee	
oh, damn	
hi i'm penny this is my friend, sheldon	
we're not friends at the moment depends on how this goes	
right, right anyway, sheldon here is a huge fan of yours, and he was supposed to meet you the other day at the comic book store, but he kind of ended up in jail	
i see and you thought you'd just come over to my house uninvited	
you said we were invited	
oh, no, no, i said i'm inviting you to come with me to stan lee's house	
you know, you fan boys are unbelievable do you think you can just ring my doorbell any time you want i mean, why don't you just come on in and watch the lakers game with me	
well, i'm not much of a sports fan, but thank you	
i'm sorry	
he doesn't really understand sarcasm	
well, i'll give him something he'll understand	
joanie, call the police	
nice to meet you	
fantastic four, daredevil, invincible iron man, happy hogan, curt connors	
would you just let it go	
and worst of all, fin fang foom	
hey, where've you been	
i'll tell you where i've been you boys may have had gelato with stan lee and gotten autographed comics, but i saw the inside of his house and got an autographed application for a restraining order	
sweet	
plus, i get to hang out with him again at the hearing	
this is going to look great hanging next to my restraining order from leonard nimoy
