seems like forever, since the four of us have been out to eat, you know just the guys	
oh, god yes, we get it you have a girlfriend now	
a little jealous, are we	
no, i'm not jealous all right, i'd kill a hobo if it'll get me laid	
now, can we order	
oh, dear lord, they redid the menu	
so what	
it's the same food	
oh, is it look at this general tso's chicken is no longer listed under "specialties" it's now under "chicken"	
so	
yes, general tso not "tso," the chicken, "so" the question	
so	
so, why is it no longer a specialty did the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself and look over here	
"shrimp in mobster sauce" what is "mobster sauce"	
it's obviously a typo	
perhaps or perhaps this restaurant's now a front for organized crime for all we know, the mobster sauce contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters	
no, no, no, no i think it just means it's the kind of sauce that mobsters like	
it doesn't mean any of that it's a typo	
you know what let's just get a pizza	
good idea	
we'll go to corleone's	
sure, no mobsters there	
you know, the more i think about it, the mobster sauce couldn't possibly contain chunks of mobster	
and why is that	
it was listed under "seafood"	
what if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes	
leonard, are we having a serious conversation or not leonard	
what the the tv is gone so are our laptops	
oh, God oh, God oh, God	
it's all right they didn't take my comic books	
they took our tv, two laptops, four external harddrives, our ps, our ps, our xbox, xbox , our classic nintendo, our super nintendo, our nintendo  and our wii	
we like games	
right, games	
they took halo , halo , halo , call of duty , call of duty , call of duty , rock band, rock band , final fantasy  thru , the legend of zelda, the legend of zelda ocarina of time, the legend of Zelda twilight princess, super mario brothers, super mario galaxy, mario and sonic at the winter Olympics and ms pacman assorted video games	
when does the csi team get here	
what	
in anticipation of their arrival, i've bagged some evidence one of the thieves had the audacity to quench his thirst while ransacking our home	
you should be able to pull some good prints off this	
and now, here are my prints	
so you can rule me out as a suspect	
what about me	
i'm sorry, leonard it's too early to discount the possibility of this being an inside job	
would i be completely out of line to ask you to shoot him	
i'd be happy to put him under a hour psychiatric hold	
i'm not crazy my mother had me tested	
we're done here	
call this number, and we'll fax	
you a copy of the report	 so you can submit it to your insurance company	
ii'm sorry	
that's the end of your inquiry	
do you have any more information that might be relevant	
oh, my goodness where do i begin for instance my laptop contained four out of the five gedankenexperiments necessary for a cogent restatement of the quantum measurement problem	
how is that going to help them	
well, they could monitor scientific publications and see if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next	 couple of months if so, the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop	
good night, fellas	
come on, bochco	
what are we supposed to do now	
the only thing we can do watch tv on our phones	
until the criminals return and bludgeon us to death in our sleep	
does that mean you've ruled me out as a suspect	
oh, how i wish i could	
i do not have to urinate	
i am the master of my own bladder	
drat	
i can't believe it if i hadn't been working the dinner shift, i would've run right into the robbers	
hey, there's no reason for you to be scared	
i'm not scared	
i would've gone all Nebraska on their asses	
sheldon	
leonard and penny	
leonard	and penny	
leonard and penny	
hand me the bat	
we just had a major crime in the building, and you open the door without asking who it is	
it won't happen again	
what's up	
nothing	
i just wanted to see if you were both okay	
we're fine, sheldon	
all right, then	
good night	
good night	
that was weird,	even for him	
mmhmm	
leonard and penny

i see you're drinking wine	
yes, we are  we're about to go to bed	
uhhuh	
sheldon, do you want to sleep here tonight	
oh, as small as leonard is, i don't think the two of you'd be comfortable on the couch	
what do you want	
it's not what i want, it's what evolution wants	
human beings are primates primates have evolved to live in groups, both for protection and support	
but you don't like other people	
i do tonight	
it's scary over there	
it's getting scary here, too	
um three little kittens three little pigs	
God, i don't know star wars	
did we win can we go to bed	
good Lord i could not have made this easier hydrogen atom, h, plus pigs minus pea higgs	 bow, general zod trapped in the phantom zone	
bowzone	
pear tickle	
peartickle	
higgs boson particle how could you not get that	
he's right, penny it's all there	
sheldon, sweetie, i know you're feeling insecure, but we've really got to go to sleep	
all right	
i'll take the first watch and wake you at	
great good night	
wait, wait	
what's am that's, like, in  minutes	
just keep walking	
woman (on tv)	
it's quiet out there	
man (on tv)	
maybe a little too quiet	
where are you going just gonna take a look around outside	
bad idea	
no, jim, don't open the door	
listen to her, jim	
don't worry	
there's no one out there	
sheldon	
leonard and penny	
leonard and penny	
leonard	
and penny	
leonard	
who is it	
all right, we've got a titanium dead bolt and a reinforced jamb controlled by a stateoftheart electronic access system	
what if they cut the power	
there's a watt uninterruptible backup power supply	
what if someone steals my keys	
there are independent voice and fingerprint scanners	
what if someone kidnaps me, forces me to record my voice, and then cuts off my thumb	
i'll send them a basket of muffins now, inside, we've got motion detectors, infrared sensors, and cameras connected to a server running stateoftheart facial recognition software	
where did you get all this stuff	
eh, i got a buddy over at the department of defense	
he just gave it to you	
i'm sure he would have if i had asked	
ironically, their security isn't all that good	
raj, your car is blocking me	
intruder alert, intruder alert intruder alert	
what the hell	
intruder alert	
sorry, let me help you	
wonderful security system if we're attacked by a school of tuna	
don't worry, the net's	
going to be electrified	
you picture her on the floor, spasming uncontrollably	
better	
sheldon	
sheldon's journal security system in place however, sleep continues to elude me i've seen the underbelly of Pasadena this socalled city of roses, and it haunts me	
ah, the injustice	
i lie here awake, tormented, while out there evil lurks, probably playing donkey kong my classic nintendo	
oh, dear	
i am the master of my own bladder	
leonard and penny	
leonard and penny	
leonard and penny	
oh, my God, Sheldon what the hell are you doing out there	
i heard a noise	
it was us we knocked over a lamp	
why would you knock over a lamp	
we were going to have	
he doesn't need to know what we were doing,	
leonard	
oh	
no, she's right, i don't need to know what you were doing	
carry on	
what are you doing use the door	
good thinking perhaps i'll check the perimeter and make some warm milk	
great, you do that	
would you like me to bring you ome warm milk	
i'm lactose intolerant and you don't wish to alarm me with any more loud noises	
very thoughtful	
warm milk, penny	
no, thanks	
fine	
good night to you, sir	
miss	
sorry about that	
ugh, what can you do	
here	
intruder alert, intruder alert	
intruder alert, intruder alert	
looks like wolowitz got the net electrified	
sheldon, are you okay	
ii'm fine although i'm no longer the master of my own bladder	
my new computer came with windows	
windows  is much more user friendly than windows vista	
i don't like that don't you think looking for a new city to live in a bit of an overreaction	
our apartment was broken into,	 our security system tried to kill me, and as a result, i'm leaving pasadena forever	
tell me how that's overreacting	
come on, sheldon, you can't move don't you need to stay in one place so the mother ship can find you when it returns	
oh, if that were only true unfortunately, as i'm earthbound the foreseeable future, i need to find a location that's more hospitable than the mean streets of pasadena, like enid, Oklahoma low crime rate and highspeed internet connectivity but no model train shops sorry, enid	
is he quitting his job at the university	
oh, no, he's going to telecommute everybody's really excited about it	
all right	
boone, north carolina	
"every summer since , "boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal of the life and times of its namesake, dan'l boone"	
sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd	
penny, you're from nebraska,	
correct born and raised	
it will take me a few days to get settled after i do, i will email you detailed pdfs containing diagrams and instructions that will guide you through packing and shipping the rest of my possessions to bozeman, montana, in the meantime,	
please forward my mail	
any place specific or just the bozeman, montana loony bin	
i sense you're making a joke, but bozeman does have a comedy club called the loony bin,	
so do not forward my mail there	
oh, come on so you were the victim of a crime part of life when my greatgrandfather first came to this country, he put all his hopes and dreams into this little butcher shop he ran on the lower east side of new York you know what happened every customer who walked into that butcher shop and asked for a pound of liver, got ripped off but those people moved on, and so should you	
i am moving on	
i'm going to be a bozite	
they call themselves "bozites"	
they should it's one of the first things i plan to bring up upon arrival	
sheldon, i can't believe i'm saying this, but i'm going to miss you	
please, penny, as you know, i'm not comfortable with prolonged goodbyes and maudlin displays of emotion, so i prepared a short video	
greetings as you know, i'm not comfortable with prolonged goodbyes and maudlin displays of emotion, so i prepared this short video the four of you are three	of my closest friends and one treasured acquaintance though i cannot state categorically that my life be diminished not having you in it,i am comfortable if you choose to believe that since you intend to remain in this lawless metropolitan area statistics suggest that you will succumb to tragic and gruesome ends before we meet again	
live long and prosper	
sheldon, that's so	
you might want to lock the door behind me	
this isn't bozeman	
how the hell do i know who's the friend	and who's the acquaintance	
that is a bracing cold, an invigorating cold	
Lord, is it cold	
help you with your bags, sir	
thank you, fellow bozite	 and may i say, you are the living embodiment of all the promises made by our lovely town's chamber of commerce	
wait	
wait	
excuse me	
one ticket to pasadena,	california, please	
hey, look who's back	
interesting the acquaintance is the first to greet me
