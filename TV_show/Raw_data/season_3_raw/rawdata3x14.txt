whatcha doing	
i'm attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain	
interesting i usually just have coffee	
you've been up all night	
is it morning	
yes	
then i've been up all night	
and you're stuck	
why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus	
oh, sorry, sweetie, i can't help you till i've had my coffee	
penny, i told you if you don't put him in his crate at night he just runs around the apartment	
what is he doing now	
hmm, he's either isolating the terms of his formula and examining them individually, or looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand after peter pan cut it off	
captain hook's hand was eaten by a crocodile, not an alligator if you're going to mock me, at	
least get your facts straight	
aye, aye, captain	
i can't see it	
it just won't coalesce	
maybe you need a fresh start	
you're right	
it's a great idea, leonard thank you electrons move through graphene act as if they have no mass	
how long has he been stuck	
intellectually about  hours	
emotionally about  years	
unit cell contains two carbon atoms interior angle of a hexagon is  degrees	
have you tried rebooting him	
no, i think it's a firmware problem	
hey, it's disco night at the moonlight roller rink in glendale tonight	
who's up for getting down	
that's perfect	bernadette's been hocking me to take her roller skating	
i think penny likes to skate the four of us could double what could be better	
we're in	
great it's not like i brought it up because i wanted to go	
you can come with us	
no, it's okay i don't have to go i'm happy just to guide you and your ladies to suitable entertainment choices i'm a walking brown yelpcom	
structure, constant structure one atom	
boy, he's really gone, isn't he	
yeah, this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant	
i thought i smelled popcorn	
pattern is the same as fermions	travels on the pathways	hexagonal it's always hexagonal	
i haven't seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out the third matrix movie	
hey, those are my lima beans	
not lima beans, carbon atoms	
but if i don't eat my lima beans, i can't have my cookie	
here, you want my peas	
the peas perfect they can be electrons	
want my corn	
don't be ridiculous what would i do with corn	
so roller skating should we all grab a bite to eat first	
good pf chang's	my mom has coupons	
great your mom's not coming, right	
not this time, i promise	
okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea, and i'm very unhappy that you turned it into a double date,	
and i hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes	
the plural of coccyx is coccyges	
screw you	
give me back my lima beans	
oh, my god have you ever been so embarrassed	
not recently	
i don't know which was lamer	
their rollerskating or their disco dancing	
for me, the worst part	was when people	saw us leave with them	
you had some nice moves	out there, howard	
thanks you, too	
yeah	
did you notice all the people looking at us	
not really i was in my boogie zone	
when howard tried to do the splits	
shh	
sorry i'm moving a little slow i think i bruised my coccyx	
oh, poor baby	
don't tell koothrappali	
after you	
oh, what a gentleman	
hey, sheldon	
leonard oh, my god are you	
sheldon	
good lord you're ruining everything	
oh, damn are you okay	
do i look okay	
don't bark at me	
i fell, too	
oh, you've been falling	all night you're used to it	
sheldon, what the hell are you doing	
the same thing i've been doing for three days trying to figure out why electrons behave as if they have no mass	when traveling through a graphene sheet	with marbles	
well, i needed something bigger	than peas, now, didn't i	
sheldon, when was the last time you got any sleep	
i don't know two, three days not important i don't need sleep i need answers i need to determine wherin this swamp of unbalanced formulas squatteth the toad of truth	
toad of truth is that a physics thing	
no, that's a crazy thing	
okay, sheldon what happens to our neuroreceptors when we don't get enough rem sleep	
they lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine which leads to impaired cognitive function	
right, so march in there,	
brush your teeth and go to bed	
but i don't want to go to bed	
i'm going to count to three one	
oh, all right	
that was amazing how you handled him	
i know how to deal with stubborn children my mother used to run an illegal day care center in our basement	
leonard, you're you're	giggling in your sleep	
it's not me it's my new ringtone the joker from batman	
well, it creeps me out	
me, too, but i paid three bucks for it	
just answer the phone	
hello yeah, i'm leonard hofstadter yeah, yeah, he's my roommate	oh, god, is he okay yeah, allall right i'll be right there	
what happened	
sheldon's escaped and is terrorizing the village	
okay have fun	
hi i'm dr hofstadter where is he	
ball pit	
thanks for not calling the cops	
oh, hey, it's no big deal	
my sister's got a kid who's special	
yeah, well, he's extra special	
hey, shelly what you doing	
size ratio was all wrong couldn't visualize it	needed bigger carbon atoms	
sure, sure how did you get into this place	
back door has a fivepin tumbler system, singlecircuit alarm child's play	
you can start sorting protons	
and neutrons while i build carbon atoms	
no, i don't think so	
we need to go home now	
but i'm still working	
if you don't come out of there, i'm going to have to drag you out	
you can try, but you'll never catch me	
for god's sakes	
sheldon, come here	
bazinga	bazinga	bazinga	
of gain det and fabrleonard and penny	
what	
what, what, what	
what	
i have good news	
leonard and you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night	
your cell phone was off	
because we didn't want to be disturbed	
well, that didn't work out, did it	
sheldon, what do you want	
i came to tell you i've got the answer	
really you figured out	the graphene problem	
no, no, i'm still	
hopelessly stuck on that, but i figured out how to figure it out	
okay, you know what, leonard, i know i said i could handle your roommate, but i was wrong we're going to have to break up	
what are you talking about	
oh	
einstein	
yeah, i'm going to need a little more	
albert einstein	
keep going	
when albert einstein came up with special relativity, he was working at	the patent office so, you're going to go work at the patent office	
don't be absurd	
that's in washington you know i could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheelandspoke pattern no i'm going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are	occupied with a routine task, freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem	
sounds like a great plan	
of course it is	even talking to you is	sufficiently menial that i can feel the proverbial juices starting to flow	
okay, well, thanks for sharing with us good night	
you're welcome and good night to you, too	
oh, by the way, i was watching you sleep for a moment, and i noticed that your snoring seems to be worse when you're on your back	
leonard doesn't snore	
no, i wasn't talking to leonard	
told you	
so, mr cooper, you're looking for a job	a menial job	
like yours	
why, thank you for noticing i'm "menial employee of the month" do you have a particular field in mind	
i do for thousands of years, the lowest classes	of the human race have spent their lives laboring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters, until finally, they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged do you have anything like that	
no	
shouldn't you check your database	
no	
you didn't really type	
i didn't really have to	so, how about construction	
oh, that would be good sawing, hammering, eating out of a lunch pail as my workingclass	fellows and i sit perched precariously	on a girder high above the metropolis	
no, no this is	putting up sheetrock at a housing project in rosemead	
i could do that	
good	
one question	
yes	
what's sheetrock	
moving on how about doing deliveries for a florist	
that seems acceptable	
do you have your own car	
i don't drive	
of course you don't mr cooper, let me just ask you a question what was your last job	
senior theoretical particle physicist at caltech, focusing on m theory, or, in	layman's terms, string theory	
i see	
just give me a second	
security	
okay, i'll get those drinks started for you	
behind you	
sheldon, what the hell	are you doing	
i'm trying to get these tables cleared	we're slammed	
no, wait, wait,	
no, wait	
whwhat are you doing here	
a reasonable question i asked myself, what is the most mindnumbing, pedestrian job conceivable,	and three answers came to mind	uh, toll booth attendant, apple store genius and what penny does now since i don't like touching other people's coins, and i refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word "genius," here i am	
you just, you just walked in and they hired you, just like that	
oh, heavens, no since i don't need to be paid,	i didn't need to be hired i simply came in, picked up a tray, and started "working for the man"	
let me get that plate out of your way	
sheldon, this is ridiculous	
is it just a moment ago, i had a minor epiphany	regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate	
bernadette, table 
thanks, sheldon	
sheldon,	
wait, this isn't even what i do	
i'm a waitress, not a busboy	
you're right that is more menial	
hello, i'm sheldon	
i'll be your server today i don't recommend the salmon	i saw it in the kitchen	
all right, one bacon cheeseburger,	
breaking two jewish dietary restrictions simultaneously	kudos	
beerbattered fish and chips now, here's your tartar sauce i also brought you salsa it's a little unconventional, but i think you'll like it it's zingy and for you, factory burrito grande no cheese, no sour cream, no ugly consequences from your lactose intolerance	
bon appãetite	
hang on	
black beans, not pinto beans	
yes	
double guacamole	
of course	
no cilantro	
nope	
lettuce shredded, not chopped yep	
you understand why i'm doing this to you	
i do	
that'll be all	
that was fun	
how long can he keep this up	
i heard about this professor at mit who melted down, bought a van, and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer he never went back to the university only to shampoo professor shamburg's shih tzu	
sheesh	
i bet if we all chipped in, we could buy sheldon a van	
but he's afraid of dogs	
yeah, that's the only thing wrong with that plan	
hey, guys, sorry you had to wait, but we are swamped	
what's this	
sheldon took our order	
sheldon doesn't work here	
well, honey, not to complain, but we were starting to think you didn't either	
is that really necessary	
good lord the interference pattern in the fracture the motion of the wave through the molecular structure i've been looking at it all wrong i can't consider the electrons as particles they move through the graphene as a wave it's a wave	
the moment to applaud would be now	
troglodytes	
sheldon where are you going	
aren't you going to clean this up	
i'm sorry i don't work here	
happy now	
i'm on a cloud	
swing me	
sheldon, come here	
bazinga	bazinga	bazinga	bazinga	bazinga
