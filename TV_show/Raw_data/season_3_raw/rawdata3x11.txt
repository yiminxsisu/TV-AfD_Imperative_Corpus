oh, i always tear up when the grinch's heart grows three sizes	
tears seem appropriate	
enlargement of the heart muscle, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure	
you really didn't like it, sheldon	
no, on the contrary i found the grinch to be a relatable, engaging character and i was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved Christmas what a buzz kill that was	
when we watch frosty the snowman, he roots for the sun	
excuse me, but the sun is essential for all life on earthvfrosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat a crime, by the way, for which he is never brought to account	
i just love decorating the christmas tree	
help you find the perfect gift	
it makes me feel like a little girl again	
we didn't have a tree when i was growing up	
really why not	
mmm, in my family, holidays weren't so much celebrated as studied for their anthropological psychological implications on human society	
oh, sounds festive	
did you at least give presents	
mmm, in a way we presented papers and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other	
sheldon, what about you did you have a christmas tree	
oh, yes we had a tree, we had a manger, we had an inflatable santa claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn and to make things even more jolly, there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighborhood wide	
so i take it you don't want to help us trim the tree	
i do not but if you insist on decorating a spider infested fire hazard in my home i would request that you add this	
what is it	
you're kidding, right it's a bust of sir isaac newton	
oh, sure, sure	
very christmasy	
wait, excuse me,	
but it's much more "christmasy" than anything you've put on the tree	
here we go	
december ,julian calendar, sir isaac newton is born Jesus, on the other hand, was actually born in the summer his birthday was moved to coincide with a traditionalpagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats which, frankly, sounds like more fun than hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake	
merry newtonmas, everyone	
i sense that's not sincere, although i have no idea why	
no, it's fine	
look, sir issac can go	
right next to this little candy cane	
no isaac goes at the top of the tree	
no, he doesn't	
i understand you dispute newton's claim that he invented calculus and you want to put Gottfried leibniz on the top	
yeah, you got me i'm a leibniz man	
well, perhaps when your mother gets here, she'll talk some sense into you	
what	
your your mother's coming when	
tomorrow	
when were you going to tell me	
um tomorrow	
why were you keeping this a secret	
well, i just i thought	
if i can interject here,	
obviously leonard is concerned that his mother won't approve of you as his mate	
why wouldn't she approve of me i'm adorable	
you are, it's just	
if i can interject again	
leonard comes from a remarkably high achieving family, who have all chosen high achieving partners he probably feels that it's doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the cheesecake factory menu	
hey, it's a big menu	
there's two pages	
just for desserts	
i know	
and those specials they change every day okay, you know what it's lame when i say it	
it's just ridiculous when you pile on	
okay	
sorry	
so what did she say when you told her we were going out	
you didn't tell her we were going out, did you	
why not	
leonard	
i'm no expert on meditation, but if you're trying to calm yourself down,	
i believe the word is "om"	
it was so nice of you to come all the way down to the airport to pick me up	
no trouble at all	
i drove, mother i'm driving now	
yes, dear mommy's proud	
i've been meaning to thank you for your notes on my paper disproving quantum brain dynamic theory	
my pleasure	
for a nonphysicist, you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brain's water molecules could not possibly form a bose condensate	
wait, wait, wait	
when did you send my mom notes on a paper	
august right after her carpal tunnel surgery	
oh, did i thank you for the flowers	
you did	
i don't really like flowers	
neither do i, but it's the social convention	
it is, isn't it	
wait, wait, wait	
you had surgery	
yes, and Sheldon sent me flowers	
no, i heard that	
then what was all that "wait, wait, wait" about	
i just don't understand why he knows more about your life than i do	
well, i would assume it's because Sheldon and i stay in touch due to mutual interest and respect, while you avoid me, due to unresolved childhood issues it's what we think caused your narcissistic personality disorder	
we discussed it at length during our last video chat	
although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling	
yes, but we are on the subject, so i'm obliged to ask	
leonard, how are you	
fine, mom how are you	
mmm, menopausal	
now i'm less fine	
have you heard your brother has gotten engaged	
no	
sheldon, why didn't you tell me	
my bad i did send a gift from both of us	
she's a remarkable girl the youngest appeals court judge in new jersey and a two time Olympic bronze medalist	
you must be very happy	
why	
i'm not marrying her	
so, how about you are you seeing anyone interesting	
well, i'm not sure about interesting, but	
not the time, sheldon	
very well shall we switch topics to isaac newton v gottfried leibniz	
it's all right, sheldon	
i will just pretend that leonard's not withholding information although, i will point out, leonard, that i am a trained psychiatrist and you are exhibiting the same secretive behavioral tics that accompanied your learning to masturbate	
isn't she brilliant,	
leonard	
how i envy you	
so, howard, have you and rajesh finally summoned the courage to express your latent homosexual feelings toward one another	
what no	
why not	
because we don't have latent homosexual feelings toward one another	
i see	
no, really i have a girlfriend now	
and where is she this evening	
she had to go out of town her grandmother died	
i see her grandmother died	
honest to god	
leonard, tell her i have a girlfriend	
i don't know what you're talking about	
what do you mean you don't know what i'm talking about	
tell her i have	a girlfriend	
all right he "has" a "girlfriend" her name is Bernadette she's working as a waitress, but she's going to school to be a microbiologist	
howard, keep in mind that the more passionately	you stick to this construct,	
the more you're hurting your partner	
do you really think your lips in my ear is helping	
hi sorry i'm late	
oh, glad you're here	
uh, sit down	
i'll get you a plate	
mom, you remember penny	
oh, yes, the waitress	
slash actress	
with the unresolved father issues has he finally come to terms with his little slugger growing breasts	
well, he sent me a football and a catcher's mitt for christmas, so i'm going to say no	
if it helps, we're all good with your breasts	
classic overcompensation	
oh, speaking of fathers, leonard, that reminds me, i'm divorcing your father	
what	
yes he was cheating on me	
no	
yes, with some waitress from the university cafeteria can you believe it a waitress oh, no offense, dear	
no, it sounded like a compliment	
when did this happen	
mmm, well, let's see sheldon, when did I leave leonard's father	
september	
oh, yes, that's right the weekend after leonard's dog died	
mitzy's dead	
she was old and blind, leonard what choice did we have	
i don't believe this	
why am i the last to know	
excuse me, leonard, i am the one who's getting a divorce,	
mitzy is the one who is dead	
why are you the one making a fuss	
you're right i'mi'mi'mi'm sorry i'm way out of line	
so, penny, what's new in your life	
nothing not a damn thing	
thank you for driving me back to my hotel	
oh, it's not a problem	
i was going to ask leonard to do it, but he seemed a bit emotionally unstable and you don't want someone like that operating heavy machinery	
no, you do not	
your "check engine" light is on	
yeah, i gotta put a sticker over that	
so, uh, you must be devastated about your divorce	
oh, not at all but i am a bit distressed to be in a vehicle that's not subjected to regular maintenance	
come on, i mean, you're not upset that your marriage is over	
well, initially i felt something akin to grief and perhaps anger, but that's the natural reaction of the limbic system to being betrayed by a loathsome son of a bitch	
sure, sure	
thankfully, my shock was somewhat mitigated by the fact that i haven't had intercourse with him in eight years	
eight years	
oh, that's nothing i'v e been responsible for my own orgasms since	
yikes	
what's so funny	
that's exactly what i say during orgasms "yikes"	
you know what i could use a drink do you want to stop for a drink	
oh, i don't drink	
i do, i'll teach you	
leonard leonard leonard	
what is it	
i made tea	
i don't want tea	
i didn't make tea for you this is my tea	
then why are you telling me	
it's a conversation starter	
that's a lousy conversation starter	
oh, is it we're conversing checkmate	
what do you want, sheldon	
what i want is to be departing the starship enterprise in a one man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid i rule known as sheldon alpha five	
i want that too	
why are you here	
to comfort you, of course	
no, that's not going to work at all	
i'll comfort you  over here	
leonard, what you're experiencing is a classic jungian crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the nevertobe realized ideal family unit	
thank you, that's very comforting	
that's not the comforting part	
it's not	
no, no the comforting part is that the germans have a term for what you're feeling weltschmerz it means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical, idealized world	
you're right, i do feel better	
well, the germans have always been a comforting people	
just remember, leonard,	
where your biological family has failed you, you always have me, your surrogate family	
you're my surrogate family	
if it's any consolation, i'm not happy about it either	
good night	
okay, now this time try drinking it all at once	
yikes	
i've been responsible for my own buzz since	
another round for me and my homegirl	
i feel a spreading warmth through my extremities	
as long as you don't feel it running down your pants, you're fine	
oh, that is fascinating i'm noticing an immediate lowering of my inhibitions for example, i'm seriously considering asking that busboy to ravish me in the alleyway while i eat cheesecake what do you think	
well, we are known for our cheesecake	
hit us again	
yes	
if a little is good, more must be better	
hey, bev, guess what	
what	
i'm sleeping with your son	
really which one	
the one from whom i live across the hall from	
well, that's convenient how did his penis turn out	
oh, beverly, i can't talk to my boyfriend's mother about his penis	
oh, fair enough what can you tell me, if anything, about that busboy's penis	
actually, i've only had the cheesecake	
one more time	
you know, leonard did not want to tell you we were dating	
really well, that means he's either embarrassed about the relationship or he doesn't care enough about his mother to tell her he's in one either way, one of us should be insulted	
well, let's go find out who	
you go get a taxi	
i'm gonna slip my business card into that busboy's back pocket, cupping his firm, right buttock as i do so leonard	
sonny boy	
get out here	
your mommy wants to talk to you	
what the hell is going on	
you're in trouble why didn't you tell me you were tapping my homegirl did i say that right	
yeah, not bad, not bad	
are you guys drunk	
well, i hope so otherwise, why would we have stopped at del taco	
now, how could you not tell me you were in a relationship with this lovely, charming young woman	
oh, thank you	
you're welcome	
is it because she's uneducated, trapped in a menial service position	
what the hell happened to "lovely and charming"	
how come you didn't tell me that you and father were getting a divorce how come you didn't tell me you had surgery how come you didn't tell me my dog died	
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait	
what i hear you saying is that you want a more intimate mother son relationship	
i do	
there it's late	
now, go to bed	
i'm getting a warm feeling spreading through my heart	
that's the del taco	
why is leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door	
speaking of warm feelings	
come here	
no, i'd rather have the busboy	
thank you for taking me to the airport	
you're very welcome	
once again, i'm driving	
i'm right here	
please, i am very hungover and in no mood to satisfy your need for approval	
sheldon, i do hope you'll forgive me for my inappropriate behavior last night	
i don't blame you you were intoxicated	
thank you	
i blame penny	
i blame penny, too	
bad penny	
wait a minute,	
what are you talking about what inappropriate behavior	
i think it's best that you not know	
agreed	
agreed	
what the hell agreed	
and i want you to take very good care of this young woman	
oh, thank you, beverly	
you're welcome	
she doesn't have much in the way of career prospects	
don't make her responsible for her own orgasms as well	
mother, remember when i was complaining that you don't communicate with me enough	
yes, dear	
i'm over it
