hold	
what	
explain your sneeze	
i'm sorry	
do you have allergies no	
is there too much pepper on your salad	
i don't put pepper on salads	
i've heard enough	
sit over there	
oh, come on i don't want to sit by myself	
that's what typhoid mary said, and clearly, her friends buckled	
guys, help me	
sheldon, come on	
yeah, it's just one sneeze	
you're on your own see you, buddy	
oh, leonard, i have something for you per our roommate agreement, this is your hour notice that i will be having a nonrelated female spending two nights in our apartment	
when you say "nonrelated female," you still mean human, right	
of course	
pets are banned under the roommate agreement, with the exception of service animals, such as seeing eye dogs and, one day, cybernetically enhanced helper monkeys	
are you planning on kidnapping a woman	
sarcasm	
yes, but mixed with genuine concern	
for your information, i'll be playing host to dr elizabeth plimpton	
the cosmological physicist from princeton	
yes	
and until you acquire a surgical mask,	
please address your comments to me through a napkin	
we've been corresponding for years about our mutual interest in	gravitational wave signatures of inflatons in the early universe and now she's under consideration for a position at our university	
why didn't you tell me you knew elizabeth plimpton i am a huge fan of hers	
i didn't realize i was obligated to share my connection	with things you're a fan of, but very well you enjoy canadian bacon i've been to toronto	
okay, fine where is she going to sleep	
my room, of course	
holy crap 	
holy crap	
yeah, um, i have a twopart question	
go ahead	
a) are you kidding me and b) seriously,	are you freaking kidding me	
a) i rarely kid	and b) when i do kid, you will know it by my use of the word "bazinga"	
so you're saying the two of you	are going to be sleeping in the same bed	
yes bazinga	
thank you	
why is a world renowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel	
well, she doesn't care for hotels and who can blame her	windows that don't open, multiuser linens, keys shaped like credit cards as if one walks around	with unassigned slots in one's wallet	
all right, i believe i have time for one more question	
yes, raj	
when can i sit with you again	
when i've seen two consecutive negative throat cultures	spaced  hours apart you know the drill all right, if you'll excuse me, i am off to start a prophylactic course of antibiotics	
i can't believe he's friends with elizabeth plimpton	
i can't believe they let him into canada	
whoa, whoa, whoa you heard the man where's your throat cultures	kidding	
sit down	
hey, sheldon	
oh, penny, excellent i have a question about these maxi pads are the wings truly functional or have i fallen victim to marketing hype	
what why are you doing with what	
the stock boy at walgreens was frustratingly uninformed on the subject	
sheldon, what are you doing with maxi pads	
i have a lady friend who will be staying with me for a few days	
oh what	
i want her to feel at home i also bought scented soaps, pantyhose, midol, calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt	specifically designed to regulate the female bowel	
wait, wait, hold on, back up	
you're having a woman stay with you	
yes why does that seem to flabbergast everybody	
oh no, no, no, no i'm not flabbergasted	i'm puzzled yeah, let's go with puzzled	
a word of warning my guest is a noted physicist	and the leading expert on quantum cosmology,	
so please try to avoid wasting her time	with female jibber jabber	
female jibber jabber	
shoe sales, hair styles, mud masks, gossip about your friends brad and angelina	
oh, they're not my friends	
i'm not surprised, considering the way you talk about them behind their backs	
she's here, she's here	
how do i look do i look smart	
oh, good grief this isn't about you	
coming	
now, listen	
one of the great minds of the st century is about to play host to one of the other great minds of the st century	
so pay attention	
years from now,	my biographer might ask	you about this event	
oh, i have so many things to tell your biographer	
dr cooper, thank goodness i completely forgot your address but then i remembered that i'd written it on my hand	lucky for me, i didn't confuse it with what i'd written	on my other hand, which are the coordinates for a newly discovered neutron star'cause if i tried to go there, i'd be crushed by hypergravity anyway, hello hello nice to finally meet you in person	
i would imagine it is this is my friend and roommate, dr leonard hofstadter	
hilo oops ii started to say "hi," and then i switched to "hello" in the middle it came out "hilo"	
duh	
uh, it's nice to meet you ii've read both your books and most of your papers ii'm leonard, i live here,	you're brilliant	
i apologize he's only an experimental physicist	
no need to apologize some of my best friends are experimental physicists well, not my best friends, but i know them my best friend is a molecular chemist named wendy i'm sorry, i'm rambling hilo	
are you hungry, thirsty	can i offer you anything	
no, she's my guest if anyone should offer her anything, it should be me	elizabeth, can i get you something perhaps a feminine hygiene product or a bowelregulating yogurt	
interesting choices based on my current needs, i guess i'd pick the yogurt	
excellent if the yogurt works, i bought some delightful	scented candles	
look, it's you	
thank you so much for opening up your home to me	
well, who wants to stay in a hotel windows that don't open, those crazy cardshaped keys	
i'm so glad you understand	
no, he doesn't understand i understand	
well, i understand, too	
you're just misappropriating my understanding	
oh i think any university would want you except, of course, any university that	had already had you because they would've already wanted you before they, you know, got you	
from the mind that brought you "hilo"	
let me show you to your room	
all right i guess i am tired	
good night, leonard uh, sleep night i mean, obously, good night i started to say "sleep tight,"	then i changed my mind in the middle i swear to god, i'm smart	
get it together, man

good to know	
in here, you'll find emergency provisions an eightday supply of	food and water, a crossbow, season two of star trek the original series	on a highdensity flash drive	
what if there's a disaster that destroys all the usb ports	
then there's really no reason to live, is there	
can i ask a question about your roommate	
he's an odd duck, isn't he	
what's his relationship status	
well, there was a misbegotten adventure	with a waitress who lives across the hall it ended as inexplicably as it began they had very little in common, except for carnal activity that's why i acquired	these noisecanceling headphones	if you decide to use them,	
please clean the ear	
pieces afterwards with the wet wipes you'll find in the bathroom they're in the drawer labeled "wet wipes"	
okay	
good i'll leave you to your nighttime ablutions	i've emailed you the morning bathroom schedule you'll also find a laminated copy in your welcome packet	it's on the back of the	emergency escape route diagram	
how thoughtful	
sleep well, my friend	
you, too	
oh, let me just get one thing it's my backup emergency supply kit the living room escape route doesn't pass through here now, good night and if there's an apocalypse, good luck	
yes	
i saw your light on is everything all right	
yeah, i just couldn't sleep	
me neither	
oh, look what i'm reading

wow you really make science come alive	
vocal test morning vocal test second vocal test	second morning vocal test morning, sheldon morning morning, sheldon morning i trust you had a pleasant night	
more than pleasant excuse me, i'm going	to relieve myself	
how do you take your coffee	
black okeydoke	
pee for houston, pee for austin, pee for the state my heart got lost in	and shake twice for texas	
something his mother taught him	
all right, elizabeth, the bathroom is yours the seat is down, and has been sanitized for your protection	
that's very thoughtful,	but i think i'll finish my coffee first	
ah, so the yogurt didn't work i'll fire off a critical email to the manufacturer	
oh, good, you're up look, my car won't start i need a ride to work	
did you once again ignore your "check engine" light	
no, mr smartypants i ignored the "fill gas tank" light	
leonard, penny wants to exploit any residual feelings you have for her in order to get a ride to work	
oh, yeah, sure, let me just put this in a travel mug	
hello	
hi

you know what it's, it's none of my business if you want to sleep with sheldon's doctor buddy right after we stopped seeing each other	
go for it	
well, now excuse me i'm uncomfortable with you recommending that leonard pursue having intercourse with dr plimpton, who i assure you has better things to do	
i'm not recommending it	i'm saying it already happened	
that's preposterous	
tell her, leonard	
well no

penny, i can still drive you
