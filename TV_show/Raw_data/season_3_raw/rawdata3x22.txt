okay, babydoll pink, let's see if you can cover up the fact that i got my dad's feet	
it's just two degrees, sheldon i just want to turn up the thermostat two degrees	
let me point out that two degrees can be the difference between water and steam	
yes, if we lived in a teakettle	
this is the temperature you agreed to in the roommate agreement	
aw, screw the roommate agreement	
no, you don't screw the roommate agreement	
the roommate agreement screws you	
you know what, go to hell and set their thermostat	
i don't have to go to hell at  degrees,	i'm there already	
who is it	
leonard	
hang on	
can i sleep on your couch tonight	
uh, well, you can try, but the people across the hall are being very noisy	
you heard that, huh	
apparently, the one fella tried	to adjust the thermostat, then the other fella went batcrap crazy	
so you agree, he's nuts	
well, not as nuts as the guy who chooses to live with him	
believe it or not, he was worse	
when i met him	
oh, i do not believe that	
you are so naive just like i was seven years ago i'd just started at the university excuse me, i'm looking for sheldon cooper's apartment	
oh, i bet you're here to check out the room for rent	
yeah	
run away, dude	
what	
run fast, run far	
that should have been my first clue	
so sheldon's last roommate tried to warn you off	
for all i knew,	he was the crazy one he had this really deranged look	
well, yeah, he'd been living with sheldon	
sure, it makes sense now anyway, i went upstairs and knocked on the door	
yeah	
dr cooper	
no, you want the crazy guy across the hall	
in retrospect, that was clue number two	
yes	
i'm leonard hofstadter i called you about the apartment you said	
i know what i said i know what you said	i know what my mother said on march ,	
what is the sixth noble gas	
what	
you said you're	a scientist what is the sixth noble gas	
uh, radon	
are you asking me or telling me	
telling you telling you	
all right, next question kirk or picard	
oh, uh, well, that's tricky um, original series	over next generation, but picard over kirk	
correct	you've passed the first	barrier to roommatehood	
you may enter	
oh, this is pretty nice	uh, the bedrooms are back there	
that depends	
i don't understand their existence is conditional	
no, but your ability to perceive their existence is conditional	on you passing the second and third barriers	
there's three	
each more daunting than the last	
have a seat	
okay	
no that's where i sit	
what's the difference	
this seat is ideally located both in relation to the heat source in the winter and a cross breeze in the summer	it also faces the television at a direct angle allowing me to immerse myself in entertainment or game play without being subjected to conversation	as a result, i've placed it in a state of eternal dibs	
can you do that	
cathedra mea, regulae meae that's latin for "my chair, my rules" now, you said on the phone that your area of study is physics	
uh, yeah, experimental physics	
hmm	
what is that	
doesn't concern you you'll be going to the university every day	
yes	
and you have a vehicle	
a car, yeah	
and you'll be willing to drive me	
can't you drive	
i can i choose not to	
okay, i suppose	i could drive you that's a point in my favor, right	
why don't you let me do this	
come on, i just asked	
last question in a postapocalyptic world, which task would you assign the highest priority locating a sustainable food source, reestablishing a functioning government, procreating, or preserving the knowledge of mankind	
uh, i'm gonna go with preserving the knowledge	
that's correct	
fyi, i would have accepted any answer other than procreating	
come, i'll show you	
the rest of the apartment	
oh, good i passed the barriers	
the second barrier	
don't get cocky	
this is the bathroom are you fairly regular	
uh, i guess	
this isn't going to work if you're guessing when do you evacuate your bowels	
when i have to	
when you have to	
i'm sorry, i don't rent to hippies	
ii'm sorry, uh, in the morning around	
i can't give you i can give you	
fine i'll take it	
third barrier passed you have won the right to see your room	
huzzah is this it	
no, this is my room people don't go in my room	
so where do you sleep	
i don't understand	
if people don't go in there, and you're people, and you are people, aren't you	
making a joke do you do this often	
on occasion	
your room you may want to repaint	
and after all that, you just moved in	
i didn't just move in first we had to iron out a few details	
"roommates agree that friday nights shall be reserved "for watching joss whedon's brilliant new series firefly"	does that really need to be in the agreement	
we might as well settle it now it's going to be on for years	
initial here	
all right, that's television and movies	section nine miscellany	the apartment's flag is a gold lion rampant on a field of azure	
we have a flag	
never fly it upside down	
unless the apartment's in distress and next "if either of us ever invents time travel, "we agree our first stop	will be this meeting today in precisely five seconds"	
okay	
that's disappointing	
why on earth did you agree to all that	
it was the best	apartment i'd seen, the rent was very reasonable and after you've passed the first three barriers you kind of want to take it all the way	
well, i'm sorry, leonard, it's very hard to feel sympathy for you	
okay, how about this let me tell you about the first time i brought a girl over	
shh just pretend we're not here	
i'm sure he'll go away	
i'm just going to keep knocking till you answer	
leonard	
leonard	
leonard	
what do you want i didn't say come in	
you asked what i wanted	i wanted to come in i'm here because you violated our roommate agreement specifically, section eight visitors, subsection c females, paragraph four coitus	
roommates shall give each other 
of impending coitus"	
i didn't even know her  hours ago	
that's it i'm out of here	
but, joyce, come on	
hours	
oh, my god	
do i get some sympathy now	
a little bit okay let me get this straight you move in with this guy, he makes you sign a ridiculous roommate agreement, then he walks into your bedroom while you're doing this	
joyce kim, and you still stay	
actually, i couldn't get too mad at him about joyce kim	
why not	
well, i was doing some government research at the time, you know, military, rocket fuel	it's kind of secret	
what does that have to do with joyce kim	
as it turns out, she was a north korean spy luckily, sheldon drove her out before i revealed anything important	which ii'm not saying i would have	
so, what, that's it you've stayed with sheldon all this time because he kept you from going to federal prison	
that was part of it the other part is what happened with the elevator	
oh, yeah, i'm wondering about that you said it was working when you moved in	
it was, but one night,	sheldon came home from work	
what is going on here	
hey, sheldon this is howard and raj they work at the university, too	
hey	
hey	
i'll get to you later what are you sitting on	
i can't speak for these guys, but i'm sitting on my tushie it's a joke	
not a good idea	
"tushie" is buttocks, right	
right	
hilarious	
explain the couch	
oh, well, there	were some people on the first floor moving out,	and they sold it to me for $ howard and raj helped me bring it up	
but what's wrong with the furniture we have	
they're lawn chairs and there was no place for company	
did it occur to you that was by design	
according to the roommate agreement, i'm entitled to allocate %	of the cubic footage of the common areas	
but you didn't notify me by email, so this is still a breach	
i did notify you	
oh, you did, did you oh, drat hoisted by my own spam filter	
what am i doing	in your spam folder	
i put you there	after you forwarded me a picture of a cat playing the piano, entitled "this is funny"	
oh, yeah, i saw that that was hilarious	
okay, what does all this have to do with the elevator	
i'm getting to it i assure you,	
you'll be sorry	you wasted your money on an ipod when microsoft comes out with theirs	
okay, do you have an opinion about everything	
yes	
and you just assume you're always right	
it's not an assumption	
change seats with me	
why	
i don't like this spot i have to keep turning my head	
fine	
ooh, it's time for babylon we don't watch babylon in this apartment	
why not	
because no one likes babylon	
i like it	
me, too	
so do i	
there you go three against one	
they don't get a vote it's one against one and according to the roommate agreement, all ties will be settled by me	
but i said no to that	
and i said yes and i settle all ties	
change seats with me	
why	
there's a draft	on my neck over here	
so, i get the draft	
you're protected by your turtleneck	
fine and it's a dickey	
hmm i'm still not comfortable of course	there's too many people here	
we can fix that	
let's leave	
yeah, we can go over to my place	
wait	
let me get my jacket	
you're not going with us	
why not	
you're the guy we're trying to get away from	
oh well, in that case,	i don't need my jacket and for the record, the correct syntax is i'm the guy from whom you're trying to get away oh, yes this is definitely going to be my spot	
okay how do you know he said that you left the room	
hey, do you want me to finish working on your man feet or not	
fine go ahead	
howard, are you having a playdate	
i don't have playdates i have colleagues	
do their parents know they're here	
no, but if you keep screaming, maybe they'll hear you	
that your dad	
she grows any more hair	on her face, yes	
oh, man	is that a twostage rocket	
three i designed the engine myself	
cool can it break mach	
oh, probably, if i could get my hands on that new fuel the government's been working on	
oh, this just might be your lucky day	
howard, what happened to the oreos i left on the counter	
i haven't seen your oreos	
just take your bath without them	
so, why was it his lucky day	
well, it turns out i had a little rocket fuel in the apartment	
what were you doing with rocket fuel in your apartment	
mm, joyce kim was kind of curious about what i did for a living, and i was going to kind of show it to her it's not important the point is, the guys and i went back to the apartment	
are we ever going to get to the elevator	
yeah, we're really close uh, uh, we're at the apartment	the trick is to	mix it into tovex in order to create a combustible gel that will generate over , kilonewtons of thrust	
cool	
nice	
won't work	
excuse me, but i've been working on this a long time	
trust me	
it'll work	
you don't see your mistake, do you	
there's no mistake	
this is for a fullscale	rocket, not a model	
well, i've adjusted the formula	
not correctly	
okay, i've had it with you you might be an expert on theoretical physics and sciencefiction programs and where to sit on a freaking couch, but this is applied physics and when it comes to applied physic uhoh	
what's happening	
a bad thing a very bad thing	
get the door	
get the door	
get the door	
get the door	
get the door	
you're waiting for the elevator	
oh right wait it's here	
give me that	
what'd you do that for i had plenty of time	
you're welcome	
not only did sheldon save my life, he didn't rat me out	to the landlord	or the police or homeland security	
okay, so, basically, you're the reason i have to walk up and down three flights of stairs every day	
so i did something stupid i'm sure you did stupid things when you were younger what were you doing seven years ago	
excuse me, i was in high school	studying, keeping my nose clean, doing volunteer work for the community	
not pregnant	
yes	
oh, ubuntu, you are my favorite linuxbased operating system	
hey	
hello	
why do i smell methacrylate	
oh, uh, clear nail polish i had a manipedi	
men can get those	
anyway, i may owe you an apology	
there's doubt	
i did agree to the thermostat setting, and i shouldn't have tried to change it	
that's not an apology simply an acknowledgement that i was right	
okay, i'm sorry	there you go so, we're good	
good what	
never mind okay if i watch some tv	
go ahead	
up next babylon	
you're not even	watching	
i can hear it	
oh, so the dialogue offends you	
i would hardly call that dialogue	
you're insane, you know that	
don't make me turn that flag upside down,	
'cause you know	i'll do it
