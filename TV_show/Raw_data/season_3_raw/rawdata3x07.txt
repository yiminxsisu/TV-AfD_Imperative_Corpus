wow, sheldon, i cannot believe you made up your own game	
it's like the slogan says,	
"the physics is theoretical,	
but the fun is real"	
we must not be playing it right	
all right, five	
one, two, three, four, five	
oh, wow, look at that my department of defense	
research grant is renewed	
oh great roll	
now you can demolish your sovietstyle cyclotron	
and build the large hadron collider	
yay	
you're a natural at this, penny	
and as the first beta testers,	
you two'll have quite the edge	
when we play with wolowitz and koothrappali on sunday	
oh, gee, sheldon,	
i don't think we can play on sunday	
why not	
because of the reasons	
that penny will now tell you	
penny	
actually, i have to pick up my friend justin from the airport	
there you go she has to pick up her friend justin at the airport	
and i can't play 'cause	
i'm going with her right	
um, yeah, if you want	
i mean, there may not be room	
he's got a lot of stuff	
like guitars and amplifiers	
wait	
what are you talking about	
my friend, justin	
pay attention,	
leonard	
that's why she can't play on sunday	
who is this justin	
your turn, leonard	
i told you about him	
no, you didn't	
roll the dice, leonard	
yeah my friend from omaha plays the guitar	
anyway, he's coming to la	
looking for some session work,	
so i told him he could just crash on my couch for a few weeks	
come on, leonard	
if you roll a six,	
penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown	
see what i mean when i say the fun is real	
hang on	
some guy is going to be sleeping on your couch	
he's not "some guy"	
he's my friend	
so by "friend,"	
do you mean "friend friend,", "gay friend," or "ex boyfriend	
"who you're now platonic with	
but still might have a thing for you friend"	
well, he's definitely not gay	
oh, hoho, a definitely	
not gay musician	
sleeping on my girlfriend's couch	
yippee	
okay, we went out a little bit,	a long time ago	
but we were never like "going out"	
okay, not to be pedantic,	
but last i checked	
"went out" was in fact the past tense of "going out"	
which i think	
we all know is a popular euphemism for "saw each other naked"	
i'll just roll for you	
do you have a problem with justin staying with me	
what was your first clue	
uhoh	
industrial accident	
you know what	
don't talk to me like i'm an idiot	
i'm not talking to you like you're an idiot	
i'm saying the whole idea is idiotic	
"you accidentally stare	at a heliumargon laser lose one turn and a retina"	
how is that not talking to me like i'm an idiot	
it's my friend,	
it's my couch,	
and it's my freakin' life	
it's also your roll	
you know what	
it is your life	
if you want to have some stupid guitarist stay on your couch, then fine	
why don't you just rent some bun beds and invite the black eyed peas	
hey, if i want to invite the entire lineup of lollapalooza to sleep in my apartment,	
i will,	
and it's none of your business	
are you listening to yourself	
do you know how childish	
you sound right now	
oh, now i'm a child	
well, at least	
i'm not an idiot anymore	
the two aren't mutually	
exclusive	
oh, you are such a	
what the hell is he doing	
he's drowning us out	
he doesn't like fighting	
sheldon, just stop	
ok, the fight is over	
oh, and fyi,	
you never even heard of the black eyed peas	
until you met me	
i heard of 'em	
didn't know they were a band	
sheldon, she's gone	
you can turn off the blender	
has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end	
no, we just had a little spat	
look on the bright side	
as the result of penny's forfeit,	
you have become the world's first winner of "research lab"	
would you like a commemorative snow cone	
i don't get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch	
hey, i thought of a game we can play in the car	
i don't want to play a game,	
sheldon	
it's called "scientists"	
now, i will name three scientists,	
then you will put them in order	of the size of their contribution to their respective fields to make this game	
even more compelling,	
you must consider only the contribution	of the man to the field,	
not the validity of the field itself	
for example	
abu musa jabir ibn hayn	
made a greater contribution to	
the discredited field of alchemy	
than halbert vanderplatt made to neurobiology	
okay, ready to have some fun	
an old boyfriend	
who's definitely not gay	
that's what a guy likes to hear "definitely"	
all right, i'll start with an easy one	
um, isaac newton, madame curie	
and niels bohr	
and then i say one little thing	
and i end up being the bad guy	
hint madame curie had her husband to help her	
what am i supposed to say	
"sure, penny, i'm cool with your old boyfriend	
sleeping in your	
apartment"	
"well, leonard, it doesn't	
matter if you're cool or not	
"because i'm penny	
and i'm pretty	
and i can do whatever the hell i want"	
"oh, i get it	
"you think you're doing me a favor just by being in a relationship with me"	
"no, no, leonard	
i'm doing you a favor	
just by being in the same room as you"	
leonard stop the car	
what	
i can't listen to the two of you fight anymore	
come on, come on,	
we're late	
calm down	
we'll make the movie	
i believe my alarm is appropriate,	
given the situation	
the movie starts in  minutes,	
which means we'll need to make all the lights on colorado boulevard,	
plus skip the concession stand,	
and preshow urination	
oh, dude, i wish you had said something	
before pounded that last red bull	
sheldon go, go,	
power rangers, go	
hey	
hey	
we're, uh, going to the movies	
no, we're not	
we're standing in the hallway,	
suffering through an awkward encounter	
hang on	
they're showing a new digital	
part of time bandits	
you wouldn't want to come,	
would you	
not really, no	
all right, invitation pointlessly offered,	
invitation declined	
as expected,	
everyone's civil,	
nobody's fighting	
have a nice evening	
just give us a minute	
oh, take all the time	
you need	
so, are we going to talk	
about last night	
are you ready to apologize	
no	
wrong answer	
but thank you for playing	
oh, come on	
this is stupid	
oh, there it is again	
you think i'm stupid	
no, there's a difference between being stupid and acting stupid	
oh, yeah well,	
there's a difference between being a jerk	
and being an ass	
no, there isn't	
they're synonyms	
well, that was rather unpleasant	
yeah, i don't think i need my preshow urination anymore	
leonard, when that woman moved in three years ago	
i told you not to talk to her,	
and now look	
we're going to be late for the movies	
hey look amazing	
spiderman	
got it	
remember this one	
spiderman loses a big fight	
and then his girlfriend breaks up with him	
hmm	
want me to get it for you	
it'll help take your mind	
off things	
hey, guys what's going	
oh, we need to kill a couple hours	
till the next showing of time bandits	
oh, well,	
no problem	
i was thinking of closing early	
and going home,	
but let's face it,	
that's just a slightly smaller lonely room filled with comic books	
thanks, stuart	
let me ask you something	
do you think it's okay for penny to have an exboyfriend sleep	
on her couch	
no, i mean, she's obviously way out of line	
thank you	
but if she dumps you,	
she'll have a new boyfriend	
by tomorrow morning	
and you'll have a new girlfriend	
when you figure out	
how to build one	
so the only question is	
how long until you fold	
i am not going to fold	
well, excuse me,	
i don't think	
penny's out of line at all	
you don't own her	
it's like my girl, beyonce says	
"if you like it, you shoulda put a ring on it"	
wolowitz	
come on	
at the very least,	
when she found out leonard was upset about it,	
she should've backed off	
you mean like	
when a guy's upset	
because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him	
and then doesn't show up	
because he's doing a juice fast with his mother	
i didn't know you were upset about that	
really did you miss all	
the subtle indicators,	
like me saying,	
"howard, i am upset"	
okay, sorry	
maybe it means something different in this country	
back in india, it means you're upset with a guy named howard	
i said i'm sorry	
sorry doesn't make up	
for the fact	
that i had to make chicken	
and rice with this vegan guy	
do you know what vegan	
chicken and rice is	
rice	
yeah, well, you think	
i was having fun,	
sitting around all night	
listening to my mother say,	
"have you ever peed so much	
in your life"	
oh, my god, you are such a mama's boy	
wolowitz	
hey, don't bring my mother into this	
you brought your mother into this	
stop it,	
both of you	
all this fighting,	
i might as well be back with my parents	
"damn it, george,	
i told you if you didn't quit drinkin' i'd leave you"	
"well, i guess that makes you a liar	
'cause i'm drunk as hell	
and you're still here"	
"stop yelling	
you're making sheldon cry"	
"i'll tell you	
what's making sheldon cry	
that i let you name him	
sheldon"	
boy, what got him so upset	
oh, sure, you can tell	
when sheldon's upset	
oh, thank you	
very much	
come back soon	
with the other half of my tip	
hey, sheldon	
what are you doing here	
this is a restaurant	
it's lunchtime	
i would think, as a waitress,	
you'd be familiar with the paradigm	
is leonard coming	
no, i believe	
leonard is waiting for you to come crawling back to him and apologize	
well, that's not gonna happen	
i assumed that would	
be your attitude	
hence, my true purpose in coming here	
which is	
i want you to crawl	
back to him and apologize	
i'm busy	
excuse me, miss	
i'd like to order lunch	
fine what do you want	
i have a few questions	
first, i notice that you offer soup and a halfsandwich	
yes	
where exactly does	
the halfsandwich come from	
are you giving me half of someone else's sandwich,	
or do i have to wait	
for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half	
no, no, sheldon, they	
just make a halfsandwich	
you can't make a halfsandwich	
if it's the half of a whole sandwich,	
it's just a small sandwich	
okay, fine, it's soup	
and a small sandwich	
is that what you want	
of course not	
i'll have my usual	
great	
aren't you going to ask me if i want a beverage	
don't you usually get lemonade	
yes	
do you want lemonade	
yes	
anything else	
yes i want you to apologize to leonard	
i am not going to apologize	
i've done nothing wrong	
he is completely overreacting	
irrelevant	
the disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable	
well, i'm sorry, sheldon, but	
this really isn't about you	
i don't follow	
yeah, yeah, i'll be right there	
look, sheldon,	
i have to go	
all right, let's assume,	
ad argumentum,	
that in this case,	
leonard is wrong	
leonard is wrong	
considering the number of transgressions	
you've committed	
that he's overlooked,	
don't you think that,	
just this once,	
you could return the favor	
i'm coming	
goodbye, sheldon	
what do you mean,	
transgressions i've committed	
were you under the impression	
that leonard has no complaints about you	
like what	
yeah, yeah, i see you	
you're making a little check sign in the air	
i got it	
just hold your horses	
what does leonard complain about	
your driving	
the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed	
that stare at him	
during your amorous activities	
your constant tardiness,	
your singing	
my singing	
that's actually from my list	
but leonard would be a fool	
if he didn't agree with it	
okay, if leonard has so	many problems with me,	
why hasn't he	
just said so	
because, according to him,	
you're oversensitive	
and have a temper	
oh, really	
well, then, do me a favor	
and tell leonard that he can drop dead	
and she wonders why	
she's constantly undertipped	
hey	
oh, good, you're home	
i need you to do me a favor	
sure	
go apologize to penny	
what	
right now would be good	
penny leonard	
although, a few minutes ago	
would have been better	
penny	
i hear you don't like my stuffed animals,	
my driving or my punctuality	
what who would tell you	
something like that	
why would you tell her something like that	
it doesn't matter	
why he told me	
it's true, isn't it	
okay, yeah, it's true,	
but i can live	
with that stuff	
what i can't live with is	
you casually informing me	
that some guy's going to be staying in your apartment without even asking me first	
that isn't even your problem	
your problem is	
you don't trust me	
oh, come on	
sheldon, have you ever once heard me say	
that i don't trust penny	
sheldon	
where did he go	
penny	
oh, your yelling must have freaked him out again	
where are you going	
you just walk away in the middle of an argument	
no	
i'm going to go find your damn roommate	
before he hurts himself	
trying to cross the street	
or something	
why didn't you say so	
oh, now i need your permission for that, too	
well, i can't read your mind, penny	
really why not	
you're so smart,	
and i'm so dumb	
raj	
raj	
raj	
koothrappali	
stop knocking	
it's open	
please tell my parents that our dark matter research is at a critical juncture,	
and i can't come home	
for my cousin sanjay's wedding	
mrs koothrappali	
sheldon,	
ask our son what we're supposed to say to mr and mrs cheldry,	
whose daughter, lakshmi	is flying in from london, for the sole purpose of meeting him	
i didn't ask you	
to set me up with lakshmi	
you should be thanking us	
yes lakshmi just got her stomach stapled	
you have an opportunity to get in good with her	
before she loses weight,	
and her selfesteem goes up	
i don't care	
and why don't you think i can find a woman for myself	
because you're ,	
and the closest thing we have to a daughterinlaw is that jewish boy howard	
ohthat is completely	
below the belt	
sheldon, tell my parents that howard and i are just friends	
sheldon	
howard and i are just friends	
fine i'll come home	
for sanjay's wedding	
sheldon	
what are you doing	
he's not a lost dog	
hey, why don't you just let me find him	
while you sit there hitting your imaginary brake	
the brake might be imaginary,	
but that stop sign	
you just ran wasn't	
what stop sign	
eyes on the road	
eyes on the road	
mother howard,	
answer the door	
i'm busy	
wolowitz i'm busy too	
you answer it	
mother	
i can't	
i'm on the toilet	
wolowitz	
for god's sake,	
i don't need to hear that	
can't you just say, "i'm busy"	
mother	
i said i'm busy,	
but that wasn't	good enough for you	
wolowitz	
you know what	
i hope it's one of those home invasion deals,	
and they shove me in the head	
mother well, if it's a home invader,	
don't tell them	
i'm on the toilet	
there's no one there	
you're hearing things,	
you crazy old lady	
hey, stuart,	
have you seen sheldon	
yeah, he's, uh, over in	the graphic novel section	
built himself a little nest	
thank you	
uh, penny	
yeah	
is everything okay	
what do you mean	
uh, sheldon told me	
you and leonard	
were having a fight	
oh, yeah, kind of	
it'sit's no big thing	
oh, good, good	
i love you	
i'm not leaving	until you talk to me	
all right,	
what's going on	
it's a little hard to explain	
he does this thing	
where he pretends	
he's in an alternate	
dimension that occupies the same physical space we're in,	
but he can't perceive us	
don't flatter yourself	
i'm just ignoring you	
come on, sheldon,	
let's go home	
look, we're done fighting	
i've heard that before	
but then,	
the next thing you know,	
i'm hiding in my bedroom,	
blaring a richard feinman lecture	
while my mom is shouting	
that jesus would forgive her	
if she put ground glass	
in my dad's meatloaf	
and my dad's on the roof skeetshooting	
her franklin mint collectible plates	
there's going to no more shouting	
and no skeetshooting	
really	
where's your friend justin	
going to sleep	
yeah where's	
he gonna sleep	
oh, my god, would you let this go	
stuart	
i'd let it go	
why should i let it go	
why don't you just tell the guy	
to find another place to sleep	
oh, for god's sakes	
so, you have childhood issues	
we all have childhood issues at some point, you just need	
to grow up and get past them	
robot	
fire fire	
leonard, will you just	
let me handle this, please	
again fire fire	
let justlook	
sheldon, please, try and understand	
look, leonard and i are in a relationship,	
and occasionally,	
we're going to fight	
but no matter	
what happens between us, we will always love you	
right, leonard	
always is a long time	
sure always	
you know, how about we buy you this robot,	
and then we all go home	
i want that one	
okay, you can have that one	
oh, come on, he's just going to play with it twice,	
and then it'll end up in his closet with all the other junk	
buy him the robot, leonard	
can i get this comic book, too	
yes, you can	
we meet again	
so what did justin say	
when you told him	
he couldn't sleep	
on your couch	
he's a musician	
he'll sleep in his own vomit, if he has to	
i should have asked for much more	
than a comic book and a robot
