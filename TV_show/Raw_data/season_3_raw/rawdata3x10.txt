hey, leonard, check this out	
leonard, she's doing it again	
i think it upsets Sheldon when you play with the food	
no	
it upsets sheldon when she willynilly takes it from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution	
this is essentially why you have famine in india	
you want me to put it back	
leonard	
it upsets sheldon when you play with the sheldon	
what's up, my nerdizzles	
raj, sheldon, i want you to meet my girlfriend bernadette	
hello leonard, penny, you know my girlfriend bernadette	
yeah hey	
bernadette, say fo'shizzle to my nerdizzles	
i don't think i can i don't have howard's street cred	
i hope it's all right i told my girlfriend Bernadette she could join us for dinner	
sure the more, the merrier wa no, that's a false equivalency more does not equal merry if there were , people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating	
no, we'd be suffocating	
sheldon	
don't "sheldon" me	
we ordered for five people, not six	
oh, come on, it's fine	
we'll just put it all on the table, you know, family style	
oh, sure and while we're at it,	
why don't we put our hands behind our backs, have an old fashioned eating contest	
relax, it'll be fine	
sit down, you guys	
no no no	
what	
oh, yeah, you can't sit there	
why not	
that's where sheldon sits	
he can't sit somewhere else	
no, no, no you see, in the winter,	
that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he's warm, yet not so close that he sweats in the summer, it's directly in the path of a crossbreeze created by opening windows there and there it faces the television at an angle that isn't direct, so he can still talk to everybody, yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted	
perhaps there's hope for you after all	
ooh, i love your shoes	
oh, thanks	
they are cute, aren't they	
where'd you get them shoes for less i've been meaning to go over there	
oh, great selection, great prices	
my mother was right hell is real	
come on, sheldon	
let the womenfolk chat	
womenfolk	
gals	
chicks	
uteroamericans	
just eat your dinner	
don't take him too seriously	
a lot of what he says is intended as humor	
yeah, well, i don't think it's very funny	
me neither, but he just lights up when i laugh	
howard, never let her go	
so, leonard, howard says you're working on fundamental tests of quantum mechanics	
i am	
are you interested in physics	
oh, i find it fascinating	
if i hadn't gone into microbiology, i probably would have gone into physics or ice dancing	
actually, my tests of the aharonovbohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point right now, we're testing the phase shift due to an electric potential	
that's amazing	
sheldon yes	
leonard's work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels	
while i appreciate the "oh, snap," i'm uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear	
are you going to try to set up the voltages using tunnel junctions	
yes, i am	
you want to see a simulation on my laptop	
oh, yeah, show me	
in microbiology, the most exciting thing i get to work with is yeast	
howard	
yeah	
your shoes are delightful	
where did you get them	
what	
bazinga i don't care	
ha eat my dust,	
racially stereotypical plumber	
that's not fair	
i got stuck behind a tree	
and a cow and a penguin	
face it, dude,	
whether it's a real car or a virtual cartoon car, you can't drive	
just need a little more practice	
what you need is cheat codes, motor skills and a magic genie who grants wishes to little boys who suck at mario kart	
hey, sheldon, can i talk to you for a second	
it's not about shoes, is it i don't think i could go through that again	
it's not about shoes	
then speak	
um, actually, can we do it in private	
all right	
go away	
i agree, it's rude, but she asked for privacy	
thanks, raj	
okay, so here's the thing	
i was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics	
a little physics	
there's no such thing	
physics encompasses the entire universe, from quantum particles to supernovas, from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies	
yeah, okay, cool i don't need the pbs special	
i just want to know enough so i can talk to leonard about his job you know, like bernadette does	
why can't leonard teach you	
'cause i want to surprise him	
can't you surprise him in some other way for example, i'm sure he'd be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment	
come on, sheldon, this is important to me	
penny, this would be a massive undertaking, and my time is both limited and valuable	
you're sitting here playing video games all day	
okay, point	
what sort of foundation do you have did you take any science classes in school	
sure i did the one with the frogs	
the one with the frogs	
yeah, actually, it was pretty cool a lot of the girls threw up, but i gutted that thing like a deer	
i'm sorry, penny i don't think so	
oh, come on a smart guy like you, it'll be a challenge	
you can make it like an experiment	
interesting i suppose if someone could teach sign language to koko the gorilla i could teach you some rudimentary physics	
great it's a little insulting, but great i'll be koko	
not likely koko learned to understand over , words, not one of which had anything to do with shoes	
hey, fellas this is my girlfriend Bernadette my girlfriend bernadette	
who are all those people	
have no idea	
hey, leonard	
hi hey, look, it's howard and his girlfriend bernadette	
thought i'd give the little woman a tour of the old salt mines	
he doesn't mean salt mines	
he means where he works	
yeah, no, i got it	
so, how's your experiment going	
ah, terrific	
we're getting the electron accelerator set up we should be ready to go day after tomorrow	
boy, i'd love to see that	
you're welcome to come	
really oh, that'd be great	
how exciting is that	
like hanukkah in july	
do they have that	
no	
oh	
you got me again	
this isn't nonfat yogurt this is fatty fat fat	
excuse me could you grab me another napkin, sweetie	
sure thanks, honey	
all right, what is your deal	
excuse me	
inviting my girlfriend to come see your electron accelerator	
yeah so	
wow you really are a piece of work	
it's not enough you get the prom queen, you have to get the head of the decorating committee, too	
what are you talking about	
don't play innocent with me	
i practically invented using fancy lab equipment to seduce women	
has it ever worked	
not so far, but that's not the point	
howard, relax	
i'm not interested in your girlfriend	
i hope not because you don't want to mess with me i'm crazy	
i believe you	
research journal, entry one i'm about to embark on one of the great challenges of my scientific career teaching penny physics i'm calling it project gorilla	
hey, sheldon	
come in take a seat	
subject has arrived i've extended a friendly casual greeting ready to get started	
one moment	
subject appears well rested and enthusiastic apparently, ignorance is bliss all right, let us begin where's your notebook	
um, i don't have one	
how are you going to take notes without a notebook	
i have to take notes	
how else are you gonna study for the tests	
there's gonna be a test	
testsss	
here it's collegeruled i hope that's not too intimidating	
thank you	
you're welcome	
now, introduction to physics what is physics physics comes from the ancient greek word "physika "	
it's at this point that you'll want to start taking notes	
"physika" means the science of natural things and it is there, in ancient greece, that our story begins	
ancient greece hush	
if you have questions,	
raise your hand	
it's a warm summer evening, circa  bc you've finished your shopping at the local market, or agora and you look up at the night sky there you notice some of the stars seem to move, so you name them "planetes," or "wanderer " yes, penny	
um, does this have anything to do with leonard's work	
this is the beginning of a ,year journey we're going to take together from the ancient greeks through isaac newton to niels bohr to erwin schrodinger to the dutch researchers that leonard is currently ripping off	
, years	
yeah, give or take	
as i was saying, it's a warm summer evening in ancient greece	
yes, penny	
i have to go to the bathroom	
can't you hold it	
not for , years	
project gorilla, entry two i am exhausted	
howard huh	
it unhooks in the front	
oh, that explains a lot	
howard, i'm home	
of course	
senior fitness was cancelled	
it turns out you can forget how to ride a bike	
i'm fine, but, oy, did sam harpootian eat gravel	
that's great, ma	
what's great about an yearold armenian man with half his chin scraped off	
i guess i should go	
no, no, don't move	
hey, ma, can i have lamb stew for dinner	
lamb stew i'd have to go to the supermarket	
please	
i got a real hankering	
oh, i can't say no to my little tushy face i'll be back soon	
thanks, ma	
do you want the regular peas or the le seur	
always le seur peas with lamb stew	
you're right when you're right, you're right	
what if they're out of the le seur	
then get the regular	
all right you don't have to yell	
sorry about that	
let me just put that on vibrate	
i'm already on vibrate	
you know, that one i got	
howard, did you say something to leonard about me	
uh, what do you mean	
he says if i go see his experiment tomorrow it might weird you out	
really he said that	
you're not jealous of leonard, are you	
me no	
i may have mentioned that it's a little inappropriate to be asking another man's girlfriend to his experiment without first discussing it with said man	
are you saying i need to ask your permission to hang out with leonard	
i didn't say anything like that i said leonard has to ask my permission	
come on, i don't want to eat lamb stew with my mother	
damn, i was this close on the bra	
now, remember, newton realized that aristotle was wrong	
and force was not necessary to maintain motion so let's plug in our meters per second squared	
as "a" and we get force earth gravity equals mass times meters per second per second so we can see that "ma" equals "mg" and what do we know from this	
uh, we know that newton was a really smart cookie oh is that where fig newtons come from	
no, fig newtons are named after a small town in massachusetts	
don't write that down sorry	
now, if "ma" equals "mg," what does that imply	
i don't know	
how can you not know	
i just told you	
have you suffered a recent blow to the head	
hey you don't have to be so mean	
i'm sorry	
have you suffered a recent blow to the head	
no, you just suck at teaching really	
of those two explanations, which one seems the most likely	
oh, god	
sheldon, i'm trying to understand, but you're going too fast	
can you just back up a little bit	
all right	
it's a warm summer evening in ancient greece	
not that far back	
okay	
at what point did you begin to feel lost	
i don't know	
where were we looking up at the night sky	
greece damn it	
there's no need to get frustrated people learn at different rates	
unlike objects falling in a vacuum, which "ma" equals "mg" squared	
no	
aristotle	
no	
five	
oh	
then i don't know	
why are you crying	
because i'm stupid	
that's no reason to cry one cries because one is sad for example, i cry because others are stupid and it makes me sad	
okay, look, can we just please forget about all this extra stuff and can you just tell me what leonard does	
all right	
leonard is attempting to learn why subatomic particles move the way they do	
really that's it well, that doesn't sound so complicated	
it's not that's why leonard does it	
okay, i just have one question what exactly are subatomic particles	
a good question	
thank you	
and to answer it, we first must ask ourselves "what is physics"	
oh, balls	
it's a warm summer evening in ancient greece	
okay, i got a bone to pick with you	
what did i do now	
i was in bed with bernadette, and you text blocked me	
what	
we were completely naked, about to devour each other when, you text her that i have a problem with her hanging out with you	
you do have a problem with her hanging out with me	
yeah, but that's not what you tell her	
what was i supposed to tell her	
i don't know something that doesn't make me come off as a petty, jealous douche	
and what would that be	
come on, do i have to think of everything	
hey, leonard am i too late to see the experiment	
oh, hi hi	
what are you doing here	
same thing you're doing here	
i came to see leonard's experiment	
no, you didn't	
you said leonard's experiment was stupid	
you told her my experiment was stupid	
i was just repeating what sheldon said	
let's not get off topic	
bernadette, i need to apologize i was wrong to tell you who you should be friends with	
should i, um, leave you two alone	
no, leonard, you should hear this	
okay, good, 'cause i wasn't really gonna go	
look, i know i come off as confident and worldly, but the truth is i'm not	
we're shocked	
which is why i tend to feel threatened by other guys or loud noises, clowns and nuns but i now realize how foolish that is	
he had a panic attack once when he got his head stuck in a sweater	
it was a full turtleneck	
why aren't you helping me	
i don't know maybe because i'm crazy	
bernadette, please, i'm asking you to give me another chance	
what do you think, leonard should i give him another chance	
it's up to you	
he didn't call your experiment stupid	
come here, tushy face	
"tushy face "	
raj, you should've seen leonard's experiment the interference pattern was so cool when the electron beam was on	
glad you enjoyed it most people aren't that interested in what i do	
actually, that's not true, leonard in fact, recently i've been thinking that given the parameters of your experiment, the transport of electrons through the aperture of the nanofabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different than the experiment already conducted in the netherlands	
their observed phase shift in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring already conclusively demonstrated the electric analogue of the aharonovbohm quantuminterference effect that's it that's all i know oh, wait fig newtons were named after a town in massachusetts,
