oh, damn, they canceled my visa oh, yay, a new mastercard	
uhoh	
what	
i was going to get my mail	
okay	
are are you hoping to get it telepathically	
i think you mean telekinetically	
and no i just wasn't sure of the proper protocol	
now that you and leonard are no longer having coitus	
God, can we please just say "no longer seeing each other"	
well, we could if it were true but as you live in the same building, see each other all the time the variable which has changed is the coitus	
okay, here's the protocol you and i are still friends, and you stop saying "coitus"	
good, good i'm glad we're still friends	
really	
oh, yes it was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life i'd hate for that effort to have been in vain	
right	
just to be clear, do i have to stop saying "coitus" with everyone or just you	
everyone	
harsh terms	
but all right i'll just substitute "intercourse"	
great	
or "fornication"	
yeah but that has judgmental overtones, so i'll hold that in reserve	
so, how you been	
well, my existence is a continuum, so i've been what i am at each point in the implied time period	
you're just coitusing with me,aren't you	
bazinga mmhmm	
how's leonard doing	
he seems all right	
although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on oh, but now that i think of it,  he asked me not to tell you that	
i'll pretend i didn't hear it	
i'd rather you pretend i didn't say it	
i see you bought mama italia marinara spaghetti sauce	
yep	
that's the sauce my mother uses she likes cooking Italian because according to her, that's what the romans made Jesus eat	
interesting	
i'll have to have you over for spaghetti some night	
i'm hungry now	
oh um, okay why don't you give me an hour and come over	
will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce	
i don't have hot dogs	
oh, it's all right i do	
oh you're in for what my mother calls "a real eyetalian treat""	
hey, where you been	
i was talking with penny	
what's wrong with you you can't hang out with	your roommate's ex	
that's totally uncool	
no, it's fine i don't care i'm over it	
yeah, he's over it that's why he's been whining all day about trying to invent that memory wiper gizmo from men in black	
is he making any progress because i'd like to erase ben affleck as daredevil	
so would ben affleck	
the point is,in a situation like this you got to pick sides	
you're either on team leonard or team penny	
which one picks last	
what	
well, usually i'm on the team that picks last unless there's a kid in a wheelchair	
sheldon, i got you your tangerine chicken	
i hope you're hungry	
well, of course i'm hungry and as i have no plans to eat with any other team, i will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto	
mm, mm, mm	
okay	
just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs	
i don't know why	
just making dinner conversation	
go, team leonard	
oh, god, this is good	
let me ask you a question do you believe you're going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork	
jews don't have hell we have acid reflux	
do you want the last dumpling, sheldon	
certainly it's not like i have to moderate my food intake	
because i'm planning on eating again very shortly	
mm, mm, mm	
so, you guys want to do something tonight	
nah, i can't i got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class	
overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool looks like the manatee tank at sea world	
what about you, raj	
oh, there it is now that you don't have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again	
i never stopped hanging	 out with you oh, please, we all know i'm the friend you call when you have no other options if we were the justice league, i'd be aquaman	
i wish you were aquaman then i could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank	
excuse me, i'm thirsty, so i'm going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a beverage	
you know what i'll just spend the evening alone	
what, suddenly i'm not good enough for you	
ah	
i do so love beverages now i think i'll take my afterdinner walk	
since when do you take afterdinner walks	
yeah, since when do you take walks	
i read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know me, if there's one thing i like more than a refreshing beverage,it's serotonin byebye	
hold on	
i'll walk down with you	
oh	
that's not necessary	
you can go first	
or we could go together	
i can't think of a reason why not	
let's go	
hold on	
nope, no reason	
i've missed you	
all right, say hello to your mother for me	
okay	
what	
you said you were going for a walk	
i didn't say outside	
so what, you're just gonna walk up and down the stairs	
no, of course not that would be odd and suspicious behavior	
here, russell here, boy	
which way are you going	
which way are you going	
i parked my scooter down the block	
i'm going the other way bye	
bye	
actually, i'm this way	
do i smell hot dogs	
no i mean, i have no idea what you smell	
i definitely smell raw hot dog	
perhaps you're getting a brain tumor	
all right, have a nice walk	
i shall have a nice scoot	
you might want to stand back	
i'm sitting on top of  horses here	
oh hello, doggie	 nice doggie i bet you think you smell hot dogs look, a cat	
sheldon penny penny penny	
here i had to trade the others for my life	
hey, leonard	
yeah	
i haven't had sex in a year	
where you going with this, raj	
don't flatter yourself, dude	
i want to go out and meet a woman	
so, go	
well, i need a wingman	
i don't want to come off	 like a lonely loser	
and you think my presence will help with that	
well, i do next to you, i'll look like a catch	
i'm not going out tonight, raj	
all right	
would you mind if i went to your room and downloaded some asian pornography	
very much	
doesn't have to be asian	
don't worry	
you'll meet a girl someday	
no, i won't yes, you will, and she'll be beautiful and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman	
you really think so	
i do, and you'll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart and she'll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces	
but we'll have sex first, right	
mmm, mmm, mmm	
that's eyetalian	
so, um, was leonard okay with you coming over	
oh, yes in fact, he said, "i'm fine i don't care" and he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal	
well, good i'm also pleased to report that he's all cried out over you	
he's been crying	
oh, i believe that was something else i wasn't supposed to mention	
oh, God, i feel terrible	
do you have a stomachache, too	
no why, do you	
no	
why did you ask if i had one, too	
just making polite dinner conversation	
your turn	
all right so, what's new in your life	
well, my new shoes are not made for running	
have you been running	
no	
it's just a suspicion i have	
mmm, mmm, mmm	
i'm so glad you like it i do leonard never cooks for me	
well, maybe that's 'cause leonard can't cook	
you can't cook and you made me this	
whatever	
ooh, i'm gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge	
oh, lord, i'm in jewish hell	
look at this	
do you think she's really doing that or is it photoshop	
i'm pretty sure martha stewart never got naked with a room full of big, fat japanese guys	
you don't know that prison changes people	
hey, where you been	
i told you, walking	
for an hour and a half	
i got lost	
how could you get lost your phone has gps	
satellites are down solar flares	
there are no solar flares right now	
yes, there are	
dude, i'm an astrophysicist there were solar flares, i'd be all up in it	
i'm sorry i misspoke	
what i meant to say was my battery died	
what the hell was that about	
i don't know	
do you think this is really Hillary clinton doing it with oprah	
oh, we really need to get you a girl	
sheldon leonard leonard leonard	
oh, just come in	
thanks for seeing me on such short notice	
what do you want, sheldon	
maybe this isn't a good time	
tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God i will kill you	
do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation	
sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me	
what do you want	
you may want to sit down	
i'm in bed	
point taken	
you may want to sit up	
sheldon	
i've been seeing penny behind your back	
okay	
when you say "seeing penny, " what exactly does that mean	
we had dinner last night she made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it	
well, little hot dog i gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog a real, big dog a hell hound	
tangential to the primary story how about i circle back to it	
fine	
why did you have dinner with penny	
i told you, she made spaghetti with little hot dogs	
i like spaghetti with little hot dogs	
then why did you have chinese food with us	
i didn't want to upset you howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money	
is it possible he said, "bros before hos"	
yes, but i rephrased it to avoid offending the hos	
sheldon, i don't care if you want to be friends with penny	
oh well, so the emotional turmoil that's been keeping me from achieving rem sleep was entirely unjustified	
yes	
well then as my	meemaw would say, "looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon"	
i guess not	
and now, as promised, the tangent sheldon and the hell hound or how i lost my hot dogs	
oh, um	
i, i can come back don't be silly	
we're neighbors we're going to run into each other may as well get used to it	
yeah, i guess you're right	
you used to it yet	
nope me neither	
oh, sheldon seemed to think that i would be upset about you hanging out with him but i just want you to know it's fine	
oh, oh, good, because, um, his mother called me	
his mother	
yeah, she wants me take him shopping for sheets and towels	
i was going to do that	
oh, well, then you do it	
no, i don't want to do it	
you can do it	
okay, you can take him for shoes	
i just took him for shoes	
well, all i know is he says they hurt his feet	
fine i'll take him for shoes next saturday	
oh, no, no, no a bunch of us from work are going to Disneyland next Saturday and sheldon wants to come	
you're taking him to disneyland	
well, he heard me making plans on the phone was i going to say "no"	
all right	but let me know if you're going to stuff him with junk food	
i don't want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste	
we're going to Disneyland he's going to eat junk food	
all i'm saying is give me a headsup	
okay, whatever	
and don't let him go on space mountain after he eats	
he'll say he can handle it, but i promise you'll end up with churro puke on your shoes	
all right, got it is there anything else	
yeah, don't let goofy near him he'll have nightmares and i'll have to deal with it	
what's the problem with goofy	
wish i knew he's fine with pluto	
hey, do you think the elastic woman in the incredibles needs to use birth control	 or can she just be a diaphra	
well, that's it	
we're officially out of things to talk about	
we're home	
it's where have you been we stayed for the California adventure water show it was pure disney magic	
i was going to see that with him	
how was i supposed to know that	
it's all right	
i'll see it again with you and i have food here	
you said you were going to call	
i know, i know	
i can still eat	
no, you already threw up once go put on your pjs and brush your teeth	
okay, but just don't fight	
we are not fighting	
just go	
aren't you going to thank penny	for taking you to disneyland	
thank you, penny	
you're welcome, sweetie	
want a cup of coffee	
oh, um, i should probably get going	
come on it's just a cup of coffee	
uh, yeah, the whole thing seems a little twisted to me, too	
what am i smelling	
sheldon's churro on my shoes	
he's such an angel when he's asleep	
yeah	
shame he has to wake up	
i think we can do it smother sheldon in his sleep	
wouldn't that be wrong	
no, be friends you and me	
oh sure absolutely	
good i'm glad	
here's a idea i'm just throwing it out there friends who have sex	
good night, leonard	
kidding	
just a couple of friends goofin' around	
no, goofy, no
