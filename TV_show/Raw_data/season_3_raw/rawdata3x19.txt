having a little trouble catching your breath there	
no, no, i'm good	
if my pe teachers had told me this is what i was training for, i would have tried a lot harder	
"do or do not there is no try"	
did you just quote star wars	
i believe i quoted empire strikes back	
oh, my God i'm lying in bed with a beautiful woman who can quote yoda	
i love you, penny	
oh thank you	
you're welcome	
i just wanted to put that out there	
oh, yeah, no, I i'm i'm glad	
good glad is good	
yeah	
yeah	
no, no	
um	
so, it's getting pretty late we should probably go to sleep	
yeah	
okay	
yeah, probably	
okay, good night, sweetie	
good night	
hey, leonard, where do you come down on giant ants	
sheldon says impossible howard and i say not only possible, but as a mode of transportation, way cooler than a batmobile	
you are ignoring the squarecube law the giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton and for the record, the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is jet pack, hoverboard, transporter, batmobile, and then giant ant	
seriously	
you have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants	
what's with him	
perhaps he's at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle	
are you saying he's manstrating	
not literally but as far back as the th century, scientists observed a day fluctuation in men's hormone levels	
interesting that might explain my weepy days in the middle of the month you know what i'm talking about	
okay, forget giant ants	
how about giant rabbits	
big or small, i don't like rabbits they always look like they're about to say something, but they never do	
rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size and on a side note, they are one of the few mammals whose scrotum is in front of the penis	
maybe that's what they want to talk about	
leonard, where do you stand on giant rabbits and scrotal position	
i honestly don't care	
really because every time we've talked about unusual animal genitals, you've always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions	
what do you want from me	
i just don't give a rat's ass	
would that be a giant rat's ass	
for the record, giant rats are possible	
can we please talk about something else	
maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet	
okay, how about this for a topic why is leonard being a giant douche	
assuming giant douches are possible	
of course they are	
leonard's being one	
maybe he's having a lover's spat with penny	
no, there was no spat	
oh, but something happened	
i don't want to talk about it but i sense you're going to and i don't want to hear about it	
excuse me	
what'd you do, Romeo you pour maple syrup all over your body and ask her if she was in the mood for a short stack	
did you think it would be funny to put on a pair of her panties and jump around, but it wound up just creeping her out	
what no	
i'm just asking, dude	
it happens	
you guys still on	 for bowling tonight	
oh, yes in fact, i've prepared some trash talk for the occasion you bowl like your mama unless, of course, she bowls well in which case, you bowl nothing like her	
oh ouch	
that is what is referred to as a burn on you	
did you ask her to start waxing	
no	
did you start waxing	
no	
while making love, did you accidentally spank your own ass and cry out, "mommy"	
i'm walking away from you now	
that wasn't a no	
yeah, i think we're getting close	
did you take a benadryl and fall asleep while pleasuring her because you can die that way	
oh, that would be a good way to go	
hi	
oh, hey good, penny bowling tonight at 7:00	
at	
oh, right, bowling	
you don't have to come if you don't want to	
no, no, it's okay i mean, let's face it, you guys would get creamed without me	
we would indeed	
in this particular case, your lack of femininity works to our advantage	
it's always nice chatting with you, sheldon	
sarcasm thinly veiled contempt	
got it	
pacific daylight time	
bite me	
please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes	
i thought you were bringing your own bowling shoes	
these are my own bowling shoes	
then what's with the disinfectant	
i know where my feet have been	
hey, penny and you guys albino bob couldn't make it, so i brought a substitute i believe some of you know wil wheaton	
hi, sheldon how's it going	
well, well, weli if it isn't wil wheaton, the green goblin to my spiderman the pope paul v to my galileo, the internet explorer to my firefox	
you're not still carrying a grudge because i beat you at that card tournament, are you	
i'm the proud owner of wilwheatonstinkscom, net, and org what does that tell you	
it tells me that i am living rentfree right here	
you ready to bowl	
oh, i'm ready	
i don't know if stuart told you what you're up against tonight, but before you stands the cocaptain of the east texas christian youth holy roller bowling league championship team to year old division	
also, penny's pretty good	
great	
then it's on	
oh, foolish wil wheaton, it was never off	
yes a common spare the miss congeniality of the bowling pageant	
before you jump on twitter to tout your modest accomplishment, how it's really done	
i am the ball my thoughts are its thoughts its holes are my holes	
yes tweet that, tweety bird	
hey, i just wanted to tell you i'm a big fan	
oh, thanks i'm sure you're probably sick of star trek questions, but whoopi Goldberg you ever hit that	
ah, beer	
the magic elixir that can turn this poor, shy indian boy into the life of the party	
oh, yeah chili cheese fry	
yes i love chili cheese fries	
really you love them	
yeah, why	
no reason	
i'm just glad to hear you're comfortable saying you love something	
do you really want to get into this right now	
get into what	
why wouldn't you love the chili cheese fries they've been in your life a long time they make you happy they deserve to know	
look, you just caught me by surprise last night i didn't know what to say	
okay, well, now you've had some time to think about it so, what do you want to say	
i'm not sure	
how can you not be sure	
okay, this isn't the place to have this conversation	
no, the place to have the conversation was in bed after i said, "i love yo""  you said, "thank you good night""	
don't push it, leonard	
i am not pushing anything	
you are	
you don't get to decide when i'm ready to say "i love you"	
ah, the premature "i love you"	
i guessed "premature"does that count	
penny penny penny	
what	
this is for you	
ice cream	
i've been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises by studying the comic strip cathy when she's upset, she says,"ack" and eats ice cream	
um ack	
if you were a cat, i would have brought you a lasagna	
did leonard send you over here	
no, we haven't spoken since your abrupt departure last night caused us to forfeit to stuart and his dastardly ringer wil wheaton	
yeah, i'm sorry about that	
i'm not too proud to admit that i cried myself to sleep	
again, i'm sorry	
and let me tell you, sleep did not come easily with leonard in the next room singing along with alanis morrisette	
you're kidding	
no clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream	
all right, sheldon, what part of this is supposed to make me feel better	
the part where i tell you i've engineered a rematch with stuart's team for tonight	
oh, honey, i don't know things are a little weird with leonard right now	
you want me to remove him from the team i'm the captain i can do that	
no, no, that's okay just let me talk to him, and i'll get back to you	
when are you going to talk to him	
i don't know he's in the laundry room now	
now woulbe a good time	
you're not gonna leave me alone until i do it, are you	
oh, i think we both know the answer to that question	
i think we should talk now	
wha no, it's okay we don't have to talk 'cause there's nothing to talk about everything's good	
really so, you didn't get all snarky 'cause i said somethingice to a bowl of chili fries	
all right, maybe i overreacted so we're in two different places emotionally so what and maybe i'm a little ahead of you that's fine in fact, it makes sense, 'cause let's face it, i've been in this relationship two years longer than you	
look, leonard, you have how much i care about you it's just that i've said the "l" word soon before, and it didn't work out very well	
really i wouldn't know what that's like	
i'm sorry	
you know what i'm talking about, though	
yeah, i do	
so, we're good	
yes, that's what i'm telling you we are good we are great	
all right fence mended, problem swept under the rug time to bowl	
yes, i was eavesdropping there's a lot at stake here	
attention, all bowlers	
i've taken the liberty of having these made for our rematch	
"the wesley crushers"	
no, not the wesley crushers the wesley crushers	
i don't get it	
wesley crusher was wil wheaton's character on star trek	
still don't get it	
it's a blindingly clever play on words by appropriating his character's name and adding the s, we imply that we we'll be the crushers of wesley	
okay, i'm sorry, honey, but the wesley crushers sounds like a bunch of people who like wesley crusher	
no again, it's not the wesley crushers it's the wesley crushers	
no, if you want it to mean you're crushing wesley, it'd be the wesley crushers	
do you people even hear yourselves	
it's not the wesley crushers it's not the wesley crushers it's the wesley crushers	
hey, look	
they named their team after m	
no, it's not the never mind	
so, we're all clear on the bet and the stakes	
oh, yes the losers will be publicly humiliated in a fashion to be chosen by the victor	
i plan on having you publish a scientific paper expounding the discredited velikovsky hypothesis	
ouch again	
hey, sheldon, i just wanted you to know that i'm really looking forward to wiping the floor with you	
oh, yes well, before i respond, let me ask you a question is your mother a good or poor bowler	
after you	
no, after you	
as we are currently crushing you, Wesley it's customary for the player on the righthand lane to bowl first	
all right	
it's a custom, not a rule	
i so loathe you	
that's right, sheldon	
embrace the dark side	
that's not even from your franchise	
i, um, i want you to know that even though we're on opposite sides, i, i bear you no ill will	
thank you, stuart it's nice to know	
mmhmm, mmhmm	
people from opposite sides often have good relationships you know, romeo and Juliet tony and maria from west side story, what'shisname and the big blue chick in avatar	
i'm gonna bowl now	
be the ball, howard	
leave me alone, sheldon	
you weren't the ball	
hey, thanks	
this is fun, huh	
yeah it's good that we got out and did something physical	
mmhmm	
gets us out of our heads you get in your head, you start to overthink, overanalyze, obsess, you worry that's not what we're doing tonight tonight we're just throwing a ball at some pins	
yeah, that's right	
mmhmm, and someday we don't know when maybe you'll love me back	
ooh, i'm up	
sheldon Sheldon sheldon sheldon	
excuse me i don't know who you're chanting for as i am currently the ball ball the ball the ball the ball the ball the ball	
thank you, jesus	
as my mother would say i'm glad you patched things up with your boyfriend	
oh, yeah, me, too it's always tough when the "l" bomb gets dropped and you're not ready for it	
tell me about it	
i dated this one girl, and i told her that i loved her, and she said she wasn't sure and she strung me along for almost two years it was brutal	
oh, i'm sorry	
thanks i wish she had just broken up with me right there, and put me out of my misery	
really	
yeah, would have been kinder	
wil, you're up	
oh, that's me	
did you let wil wheaton get in your head	
what are you talking about	
he's evil he plays evil mind games did he tell you his grandmother died	
no	
well, if he does, don't believe it	
he's not above playing the dead meemaw card	
yes enjoy the accolades now, wil wheaton,	
but like your time on star trek next generation, your smug selfsatisfaction will be shortlived	
penny, you're up	
all right,	
remember, his meemaw's alive	
and be the ball	
yeah, i got it	
we really need a strike here	
i know	
so just take your time and concentrate	
leonard, stop pressuring me	
i'm not pressuring you	
yeah, you are	
just back off	
okay, i'm sorry i'll shut up	
i didn't mean "shut up"	
fine just tell me what to do, and i'll do it	
no this isn't fair to you, leonard i'm sorry	
wait where are you going	
penny, come back	
i'll get you ice cream	
no, let her go	
are you insane if she leaves, it's over	
i'm pretty sure it's already over	
tough luck, sheldon	
you did this, didn't you	
do you think i would really break up a couple just to win a bowling match	
no, i suppose not	
good, keep thinking that	
wheaton	
mmhmm, mmhmm, yeah, i'm telling you, the matchcom chicks are much looser than on eharmony	
you know, ii gotta call you back i won a bet, and it's time to collect	
i don't know about you, but i feel empowered
