going out tonight, i'm feeling all right	
going to let it all hang out	
wanna make some noise, even raise my voice	
yeah, i wanna scream and shout	
morning, sheldon come dance with me	
no	
why not	
penny, while i subscribe to the "many worlds" theory	
which posits the existence of an infinite number of sheldons	
in an infinite number of universes, i assure you that in none of them am i dancing	
are you fun in any of them	
the math would suggest that in a few i'm a clown made of candy	
but i don't dance	
alright, want some french toast	
it's oatmeal day	
tell you what, next french toast day, i’ll make you oatmeal	
dear lord, are you still going to be here on french toast day	
morning	
look, leonard, penny made french toast	
sorry, i haven't given her your schedule yet	
it's an ical download she can put it right in her phone	
and i thought we agreed that you'd have your conjugal visits in her apartment	
we did, but there were extenuating circumstances	
i see did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness	
no, her bed kind of broke	
that doesn't seem likely	
her bed's of sturdy construction	
even the addition of a second normal size human being wouldn't cause a structural failure, much less a homunculus such as yourself	
a homunculus	
perfectly formed miniature human being	
oh, you're my little homunculus	
don't do that	
sorry	
okay, who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar	
i want oatmeal	
yes, well, i want a boyfriend whose roommate isn't a giant pain in the ass	
i'm sure that will happen soon enough	
but in the meantime, i still want oatmeal	
you know what, i give up he's impossible	
i can't be impossible, i exist	
i believe what you meant to say is, "i give up, he's improbable"	
sheldon, you really need to find a better way of dealing with penny	
what am i supposed to doeat french toast on a monday	
now, that would be impossible	
i'm just saying, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar	
you can catch even more flies with manure  what's your point	
it's a	
boy, that does smell good	
too bad it's monday	
okay, kim the night manager went on maternity leave,	
and her husband's name is sandy, right	
so get this her replacement is a woman named sandy whose husband's name is kim	
i know what are the odds	
easily calculable we begin by identifying a set of married couples with unisex names	
we then eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work	
the aged, the imprisoned and the limbless, for example look at	
sheldon it's an amazing coincidence can we leave it at that	
i'm sorry	
ooh, penny, it's just if the cheese cake factory is run by witches	
sheldon, it's as if you don't think i'll punch you	
come on, you guys, let it go	
fine, whatever	
are you finished	
well, thank you how thoughtful	
would you like a chocolate	
um, yeah, sure	
thanks	
what was that	
you said be nice to penny	
i believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice	
it does but in my experience, you don't	
there are more things in heaven and earth, horatio,	
than are dreamt of in your philosophy	
now that's you, obnoxious and insufferable	
what's going on, day dwellers	
oh, man, did the kiss army repeal "don't ask, don't tell"	
no raj and i are going to a goth club in hollywood to hang with the night people	
anybody want to come along	
oh, wow, you're actually going out like that	
no, no i'm going out like this	
howard, what did you do	
they're called tattoo sleeves look	
i got them online raj got a set, too	
fantastic, right	
put them on, have hot sex with some freaky girl with her business pierced, take them off, and i can still be buried in a jewish cemetery	
you know, i've always wanted to go to a goth nightclub	
really	
bazinga	
none of you ever see my practical jokes coming, do you	
okay, how about you two look, i've got some extra tat sleeves	
why are you carrying extras	
in case i snag one on someone's nipple ring	
uh, yeah, i think we'll pass	
oh, is the missus speaking for the couple now	
in this case, you bet she is	
yes, she's pushy, and yes, he's whipped, but that's not the expression	
come on, i want to stop at walgreens and pick up some more eyeliner	
they're gonna get beaten up at that club	
they're gonna get beaten up at walgreens	
oh, sorry, sheldon i almost sat in your spot	
did you i didn't notice	
have a chocolate	
thank you	
i think we're fitting in quite nicely	
it'd help if you weren't drinking light beer	
what's so gothic about vodka and cranberry juice	
hello it looks like blood	
did you even read the "wiki how" link i sent you on being goth	
no, i'm behind on my wikireading	
i'm kind of on a john grisham kick right now	
what	
i finished reading the pelican brief and loved it so much, i dived right into the client	
he was a lawyer himself, so his novels are accurate as well as entertaining	
just remember we are lost boys, children of the night	
great lost boys, children of the night got it	
can you pass the chex mix, please	
thank you	
we are lost boys	
good for you	
i'm actually much more lost than he is	
nice ink	
thanks	
can we buy you ladies a drink	
two light beers	
light beers well, wikihow about that	
what’s your names	
i’m howard	
raj  i’m bethany	
nice to meet you, bethany	
yes, very nice	
nice to meet you, too	
i’m sarah not that anyone cares	
do either of you ladies enjoy the novels of john grisham	
what's this cartoon called again	
demon samurai	
it’s not a cartoon it's anime	
anime you know, i knew a girl in high school named anna may	
anna may fletcher	
she was born with one nostril	
then she had this bad nose job and basically wound up with three	
you're here a lot now	
oh, am i talking too much i’m sorry zip	
thank you chocolate	
yes, please	
hey, kim yeah, i	
you know what, hold on let me take this in the hall	
you'll never guess who they got to replace you at work	
okay, i know what you're doing	
really	
yes, you're using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour	
very good	
chocolate	
no, i don't want any chocolate	
sheldon, you can't train my girlfriend like a lab rat	
actually, it turns out i can	
well, you shouldn't	
there's just no pleasing you, is there, leonard	
you weren't happy with my previous approach to dealing with her,	
so i decided to employ operant conditioning techniques,	
building on the works of thorndike and b f skinner	
by this time next week, i believe i can have her jumping out of a pool,	
balancing a beach ball on her nose	
no, this has to stop now	
i'm not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool	
i thought the "bazinga" was implied	
we're just tweaking her personality	
sanding off the rough edges, if you will	
no you’re not sanding penny	
are you saying that i am forbidden from applying a harmless,	
scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better	
yes you’re forbidden	
bad leonard	
so, what do you guys do	
oh, you know, goth stuff goth magazines, goth music	
goth food	
what's goth food	
blackened salmon	
no, i meant what do you do for jobs	
oh, we're scientists	
yeah, you know, the dark sciences	
what are the dark sciences	
well, i am an astrophysicist, and a lot of that takes place at night	
when there are vampires and miscellaneous undead out and about	
oy vay	
that sounds really cool	
does it okay if you like space stuff,	
i design components for the international space station, which is in space	
where, as i'm sure you know, no one can hear you scream	
so, what do you gals do	
i work at the gap	
really	
how about that i've been to the gap	
i've been there, as well	
i like your tshirts with the little pocket	
i work there, too not that anyone cares	
you know, this place is boring	
yeah, why don't we go somewhere else and have some fun	
okay	
sure, we like fun	
we are fun people	
dark and fun	
come on  i know a place you'll really dig	
did you bring the black condoms	
in my fanny pack	
let's go	
are you happy now	
not particularly	
my god, she didn't	
what could she possibly be talking about for so long	
obviously, waitressing at the cheese cake factory is a complex socioeconomic activity	
that requires a great deal of analysis and planning	
"bazinga "	
you know, using positive reinforcement techniques,	
i could train that behaviour out of her in a week	
no	
if you let me use negative reinforcement, i can get it done before we go to bed	
you're not squirting her in the face with water	
no, of course not	
we're talking very mild electric shocks	
no tissue damage whatsoever	
forget it	
oh, come on you can't tell me	
that you're not intrigued about the possibility of building a better girlfriend	
i'm not	
well, and penny's qualities, both good and bad, are what make her what she is	
you mean, like that highpitched, irritating laugh	
yes	
you wouldn't prefer a throaty chuckle	
you're not changing how penny laughs	
no, that would be incongruous	
i was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register	
sorry, guys that girl is freaky	
come again	
freaky	
freaky	
yeah, freaky	
have a chocolate	
thank you	
are you seriously going to deface your body just for the possibility you could have cheap sex with a strange girl you met in a bar	
yeah	
what is your mother going to say	
she's not going to see it	
she takes my temperature orally now	
what are you going to get, howard	
well, i can't really decide between a screaming devil,	
this mean little skull, or kermit the frog	
kermit the frog	
you know i’m on howard’s butt	
get the mean little skull, and i'll see if i can make him smile	
yeah, i'd like the mean little skull, please	
what are you going to get, raj	
with my luck, hepatitis	
okay, here we go	
that's just rubbing alcohol	
i know, but it was cold	
i'm putting on the stencil	
what comes after the stencil	
this	
okay, that's it no needle no pain no tattoo	
what's the big deal you’ve done this before	
no, i haven't look	
i'm sorry i’m a fraud he’s a fraud	
we're both frauds	
yeah, i think i covered that	
but i was summing up	
we're not goth	
we're just guys	
very, very smart guys	
so you were totally scamming us	
yes	
and i wouldn't blame you if you walked out of here and never wanted to see us again	
unless, of course, our bold honesty has suddenly made us attractive, huh anything	
i'm leaving	
i'm leaving, too not that anyone cares	
when we tell this story, let's end it differently	
what are you thinking maybe a big musical number	
well, i’m going to make some warm milk and then turn in	
i trust if you two are planning on engaging in amorous activities,	
you'll keep the decibel level to a minimum	
of course	
thank you	
these are so good	
unbelievable	
what	
ii was just thinking we should probably turn in, too	
well, you know, my new bed got delivered	
if you come over and put it together, you can stay at my place	
really that’s a lot of work, and it's kind of late	
yeah, but if we stay there, we won't have to be quiet	
let’s go	
interesting	
sex works even better than chocolate to modify behaviour	
i wonder if anyone else has stumbled onto that	
okay, wait  how about this	
we say there were four goth girls	
the two girls in the club had two friends	
i like it, i like it	
did they smell good despite their gothlike nature	
what's that got to do with the story	
engaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me	
fine, they smelled good	
oh, they did like jasmine and honeysuckle	
whatever	
and then they held hands and did a sexy, demonic, hokey pokey for us	
no, no look, let me just say my story all the way through	
and then you can say yours, and then we'll pick	
i’m sorry go on	
okay	
we got tattoos, and then the four girls took us to their place	
but we don't have tattoos what if someone asks to see our tattoos	
we say they're in a very intimate area	
oh, we are bad boys, aren't we	
right, right	
so, we go back to their place and then the six of us end up in a hot tub	
but we just got tattoos wouldn’t we be concerned about bacterial infection	
true okay forget the hot tub	
the point is, we each had a menage with sexy goth girls	
what a great night	
yeah	
hey, want to try a country bar tomorrow night	
maybe we'll get lucky with some sexy cowgirls	
could happen	
i wonder how they smell
