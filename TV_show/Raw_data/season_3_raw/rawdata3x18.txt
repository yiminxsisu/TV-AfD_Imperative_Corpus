okay in avatar when they gave sex in pandora they hook up their ponytails, so we know their ponytails are like their junk	
yeah so	
so, when they ride horses and fly on the birds, they also use their ponytails	
what's your point	
my point is, if i were a horse or a bird, i'd be very nervous around james cameron	
it amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details when there are more important things in the real world to worry about for example, why wasn't william shatner in the new star trek movie	
hey, Sheldon i was up in the admistration office, and i happened to overhear the name of the winner of this year's chancellor's award for science	
and you want to rub my nose in the fact that my contributions are being overlooked again	
i am the william shatner of theoretical physics	
all right, i'll play	
what self important, preeng fraud are they honoring this year	
oh, i'm so glad you asked it like that you	
i won	
you won	
i won	
this is astoshing not that i won the award no one deserves it more actually, i guess i misspoke it's not astoshing more like inevitable i'm not sure what to do first maybe i should call my mother wait i know i'm going to conduct an interview with myself and post it online	
well, good for him	
yeah, the one thing the william shatner of theoretical physics needed was an ego boost	
didn't it look like that spear going to go right through your skull	
no	
hey, you didn't want a slurpee	
at eleven,	
you don't get glasses	
oh, that will be another congratulatory call for me	
uh, mute, please	
wait, wait hang on			
flaming arrow	
hello	
oh, chancellor morton, how are you, sir	
yes, i was expecting your call	
three years ago	
sheldon	
i see	
wait what happens if i choose not to give a speech			
uhhuh	
and if i don't want to forfeit the award	
well, you've got that tied up in a neat little bow	
all right	
thank you	
problem	
what	
they expect me to give a speech at the banquet i can't give a speech	
well, no, you're mistaken you give speeches all the time what you can't do is shut up	
koothrappali	
yeah, before the movie, you did  minutes why guacamole turns brown	
it turned brown while you were talking	
i am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups i cannot speak to large crowds	
what, to you, is a large crowd	
any group big enough to trample me to death	
general rule of thumb is  adults or  children	
sheldon, congratulations	
brought you a cheesecake from work you know, 'cause of your award, not because a busboy sneezed on it	
i'm not accepting the award	
why not	
turns out the great Sheldon cooper has stage fright	
that's no reason to back out	
you know, i once got a pretty big honor in high school, and i was terrified about appearing in front of a big crowd, but i went through with it, and you know what the world looked pretty darn good sitting on a haystack in the back of a ford f as a member of the corn queen's court	
thank you	
yeah, i'll bear that in mind if i'm ever nominated for the hillbilly peace prize	
sheldon, you're being ridiculous	
am i	
let me tell you a story			
where's  children when you need them	
i was  and graduating cum laude from college "summa cum laude" is latin for "with highest honors"	
i just love how	you always skip	over the part where no one asks			
i was valedictorian and expected to give an address even now, i can remember that moment when i walked up to the podium and looked out at the crowd must have been thousands of people my heart started pounding in my chest i began to hyperventilate my vision became blurry, and before i knew it	
oh, dear	
oh, my god	
leonard	
sheldon	
sheldon, are you okay	
don't trample me			
sheldon	
come on, mother you know why i can't accept the award	
with all due respect, i don't think praying will help	
no, i have not heard the song, "jesus, take the wheel" no, no, no, no, no, no, no you don't need to start singing it yes, i'll buy it on the itunes, mother goodbye, mother	
hello	
sit down			
we want to talk to you	
am i in trouble did my mother call you	
just sit			
leonard we think we can help you with your stage fright	
oh, i doubt that i haven't figured out a way, and i'm much smarter than all of you	
yes, but you're not smarter than all of us put together	
oh, i'm sorry that is what i meant	
okay your problem is, you're trying to do this all by yourself we can help you we can be your team like, uh, professor Xavier and his xmen	
i do like the xmen	
did i see xmen	
yeah, we watched it last week you said you liked it	
oh i say a lot of things, sweetie	
so, how about it, sheldon	
i don't know if you're my xmen, what are your powers	
okay well, i am going to take you shopping, get you a ce suit might give you more coidence	
that's not exactly a mutation that would get you into xavier's school for gifted youngsters,	 
but go on			
leonard i thought i could try to analyze you and get to the root of your anxiety	
what qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind	
my mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist, and i've been in therapy ever since she accused me of breastfeeding codependently	
raj says he can teach you what did you call it i don't know some indian meditation crap	
i see	
well, i assume,  the rest of you have set the bar so low, you're saving the most impressive contribution for last	
go ahead, howard			
dazzle me			
my power is the ability to pretend like i give a damn about your piddilyass problems	
and that's seven, buddy and i appreciate the pretense	
so, what do you say, Sheldon are we your xmen	
no	
the xmen were named for the "x" in charles Xavier since i am sheldon cooper, you will be my cmen	
oh, that's not a good name	
okay, Sheldon i'm going to be leading you through a series of meditation exercises these methods come from the ancient gurus of india and have helped me overcome my own fears	
and yet, you can't speak to women	
true, but thanks to meditation, i am able to stay in the same room with them without urinating	
now	
close your eyes			
okay, but don't punch me			
what when i was little, my sister would say to me, "close your eyes,  you'll get a surprise,”  
and then she'd punch me	
i'm not going to punch you	
that's what my sister used to say	
do you want to do this or not	
i'm sorry	 
proceed			
all right	
imagine yourself in the one place you feel most at home			
where is that	
sim city more specifically, the sim city i designed sheldonopolis	
okay, you're in sheldonopolis	
where exactly	
okay in avatar when they gave sex in pandora they hook up their ponytails, so we know their ponytails are like their junk

that's what my sister used to say	
do you want to do this or not	
i'm sorry	 
proceed			
all right	
imagine yourself in the one place you feel most at home			
where is that	
sim city more specifically, the sim city i designed sheldonopolis	
okay, you're in sheldonopolis	
where exactly	
sheldon square sheldon towers sheldon stadium, home of the fighting sheldons whatever you like	
i thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation	
fine you're in sheldon square	
really this time of year it's a bit ppy	
then, put on a sweater			
suppose i could run downtown and pick up something at shelmart	
yeah, whatever	
just go buy a sweater			
you know, the ce thing about shelmart is i own it, so i get a % discount	
you own the damn thing	
just take a freaking sweater			
look, i didn't turn a profit last quarter by taking product off the shelves willylly	
all right	
you've paid for a sweater, and you're in sheldon square			
hang on			
it's a cardigan i have to button it	
oh, no	
what now	
a godzillalike monster is approaching the city	
i have to get my people to safety people of sheldonopolis, this is your mayor	
follow me			
if the children can't run,	
leave them behind			
oh, the simulated horror	
raj	
just as i suspected meditation is nothing but hokum	
i question your premise	
how is a new suit going to prevent me from passing out in front of a ballroom full of people	
it'll give you coidence	
you know, sometimes when i'm feeling all stressed out about something, i go out and buy a cute top or a fun skirt and i have a whole new outlook on life	
don't you eventually realize you're just the same stressed out person in a cute top or a fun skirt	
yeah, that's when i buy shoes	
now, let's see what we've got	
ooh	
this is ce	
it's only one color	
yeah, so	
that's a lot of money for only one color	
fine	
why don't you pick out what you like			
hmm	
sheldon	
this is pretty sharp	
no	
you're wrong	
this is great	
i had a suit like this when i was six	
okay, i think we have a winner	
where the hell'd you find that in the prom department it's ridiculous	
says the former member of the corn queen's court	
please just try this one on	
okay	
but anything i put on now is only going to suffer in comparison	
this is absurd i look like a clown	
so, Sheldon how you doing	
that's how you start a psychotherapy session "how am i doing" i was promised a riverboat journey into the jungles of my subconscious instead, i get the same question i hear from the lady who slices my bologna at ralph's	
i'm sorry, i'll start again	
would it be helpful to you if i told you about my dreams	
um, i don't know, maybe	
how did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale	
i was wearing size a million pants	
why don't we just talk			
ah the talking cure classical Freudian good choice if it will help speed things along, uh, my answers to the standard rorschach ink blot test are a) a bat, b) a bat, c) a bat, d) my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle	
why don't i just start			
sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if, on a subconscious level, they don't feel they deserve them do you think maybe that's what's happeng here	
really, leonard you're just going to try to recycle adler's doctrine of the ieriority complex i could probably get that from the woman at ralph's and she'd let me taste some pieces of cheese for free	
but it could be part of your problem let me give you an example when i was eight, i won a ribbon at the science fair for my project, "do lima beans grow better to classical music" my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of my brother's earlier "do lima beans grow worse to rock 'n' roll"i felt so guilty, i gave the ribbon back	
and how did that make you feel	
terrible	
i worked really hard on that project i stayed up all ght singing the clown's aria from Pagliacci to a lima bean sprout	
go on			
it wasn't my fault i had never seen my brother's project and my mother could've	told me before instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone	
so, i hear you saying you're angry with your mother	
damn right, i'm angry with my mother	
for God's sake, i was eight years old she humiliated me that's when the bedwetting started again	
thank you, leonard	
for what	
if someone as damaged as you can find his way to crawl out of bed each morng, i think i can face a simple award ceremony	
wait, that's it			
i thought we had a whole hour	
good eveng, ladies and gentlemen my name is dr leonard Hofstadter, and it is my very great honor to introduce the winner of this year's chancellor's award for science and my good friend, dr sheldon cooper	but before i do, i'd like to share with you a letter from sheldon's mother,	 who couldn't be here toght	
isn't that ce his mother sent him a letter	
she's proud of him i wonder what that feels like	
anyway,	
"dear shelly" that's what she calls him shelly it's a pet name you know what my mother's pet name for me is leonard but i digress "dear shelly"	
oh, dear	
what's the matter	
i'm getting dizzy	
don't worry			
you're surrounded by your cmen	
i can't do this i'm going to faint	
here, drink this			
it'll relax you	
alcohol i don't drink alcohol	
fine, faint			
i don't feel different this alcohol is defective	
here, see if this one works			
first of all, the projects were totally different i was showing that classical music nurtures lima beans and makes them grow, but my mother didn't hear me	
if you'd like to look at the relationship between nurturing and growth, i'd like to point out that my brother is eight inches taller than me	
sheldon	
i'm ready			
oh, right ladies and gentlemen, our guest of honor dr Sheldon cooper	
thanks, shorty, i'll take it from here all right, you people ready to have some fun you have a basic understanding of differential calculus and at least one year of algebraic topology	
well, then here come the jokes	
why did the chicken cross the mobius strip to get to the same side	
bazinga	
all right, a neutron walks into a bar and asks, "how much for a drink" the bartender says, "for you, no charge"	hello i know you're out there i can hear you metabolizing oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide looks like we have some academic digtaries in the audience dr randall from the geology department only man who's happy when they take his work for grate	
bada cha	
i kid the geologists, of course, but it's only 'cause i have no respect for the field let's get serious for a moment why are we all here 'cause we're scientists and what do scientists study the uverse and what's the made of i am so glad you asked there's antimony arsec, aluminum, seleum and hydrogen and oxygen and trogen and rheum and ckel, neodymium, neptuum, germaum everybody and iron americium rutheum, uraum, europium, zircoum, lutetium, vanadium just the Asians and lanthanum and osmium and astatine and radium	
penny, leonard	
would you be able to answer some questions i'm having about the events of last ght			
sure	
question one where are my pants	
you might want to check youtube	
what do i search	
it's already loaded	
just hit play			
sheldon	
all right, people, let's get down to the math it is only three dimensional thinking that limits our imagination can i take my pants off over my head of course not my body's in the way but if we had access to higher dimensions, we could move our pants around our bodies through the fourth dimension and our days of dropping trousers would be over	
oh, Lord this couldn't be any more humiliating	
give it a minute			
now, for the astronomers in the audience,	
get ready to see the dark side of the moon			
and here's uranus
