look at us getting ready for a double date	
with actual women who publicly acknowledge they're our girlfriends	
yes, actual women are the best	
i don't understand	
what other kind of women are there	
howard, artificial women are your department	
you want to take this	
no, it would just freak him out	
listen, before we leave,	
i should warn you, i'm a passionate man and i tend towards public displays of affection	
what are you trying to tell me, howard	
there might be some making out in the car or the restaurant, and i don't want Bernadette to feel uncomfortable,	
so it would help if you and penny made out, too	
don't worry	
we're planning to have sex right on the salad bar	
namaste, white people	
good news	
i rented us the four hour edition of watchmen	
got it seen it	
detailed analysis posted online	
well, then what are we going to do tonight	
uh, sorry, raj howard and i are going out to dinner with penny and bernadette yeah	
no more carefree bachelor nights for me and leonard	
these broncos have been saddled	
how did we get actual women	
great they get girlfriends,	
and they just abandon us	
it is great, isn't it	
we have a wonderful evening ahead of us we do	
oh, yes i just discovered i don't have enough room on my hard drive for a linux partition,	
so you and i are going to perform a full backup,	
reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems	
i don't want to do that	
all right	
well, i'm going to perform full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems	
what about me	
well, i understand there are several types of artificial women	
maybe you should look into that

dude, there's so many cool things we could be doing tonight look at the glendale galleria,	
"put on your best zoot suit, "it's a salute to swing music in the center court near macy's pm to  pm"	
huh huh	
a salute to zoot	
sounds like a hoot	
i'm sorry, raj, i have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight	
much less one that's linked to race riots in the s race riots	
the zoot suit riots	
oh	
i always thought that was some sort of after christmas sale	
well, then why don't we just go	to the galleria and walk around	
but i don't need anything at the galleria	
do you need anything at the galleria	
no we would just walk around and see what's what	
that's a semantically null sentence	
okay, well, how about this from the university web site pm to  pm norton hall multipurpose room, "mixer for grad students and faculty "of the science and humanities departments "whether you split atoms or infinitives, this is the place to be"	
well, that's certainly amusing, but i have no interest	
come on, Sheldon, the world is filled with people doing things outside	
let's go outside	
outside is good	
if outside is so good, why has mankind spent thousands of years trying to perfect inside	
i don't know, it's a marketing scheme	
please, sheldon, i'm a young, virile visitor from a foreign land and i need to strut my stuff let me offer you a compromise sometimes when i feel stifled and want a change of scenery, i use my imagination	
oh, boy	
one of my favorite places to visit is the two dimensional world described in edwin abbott's mathematical fantasy, "flatland"	
i don't want to go to flatland	
you're only saying that because you haven't been there	
i am now a hexagon in two dimensional space and can only perceive the edges of other objects	
oy	
is that you, raj i don't recognize your edge	
sheldon, i'm begging you i want to go to this mixer,	
and i don't want to go alone	
well, you're in luck there's a mixer here in flatland	
oh, look, there's a sexually	
attractive line segment	
you should chat her up	
what	
tell her you're a circle	
flatland gals are all hot for circles i hope you're hungry, Bernadette we're going to a terrific restaurant	
oh, yeah, i'm starved when you spend all day in a biolab, watching flesheating bacteria skeletonize small rodents, it really works up an appetite	
flesheating bacteria yet, i still want to kiss this woman what does that tell you	
that you'd be willing to die a horrible death on the off chance you'd get to second base	
oh, we're way past second base	
right, howard	
well, we kind of disagree about what the bases are	
how's your work going, penny any acting jobs	
well, the last big thing i did was this production of diary of anne frank above a bowling alley but i think things might be turning around pretty soon	
great how come	
well, promise you won't make fun of me	
of course, i would never make fun of you	
okay	
well, i went to this psychic who told me that if i cut my hair, I'm going to get a national commercial	
wh seriously you're getting career advice from a psychic	
good job not making fun of her	
she's not one of those phonies, okay she wrote a book and has her own web site	
oh, gee, why didn't you say so	
they don't let just anyone have a web site	
why are you being such a jerk	
you're surprised	
your psychic tell you I was going to be a jerk	
bite me	
come on, penny	
why don't you kids go ahead and chat	
we're gonna make out back here	
i'm sliding into third	
thanks for coming with me	
thanks for giving me your limited edition green lantern lantern	
did you really have to bring it in with you	
what if evil strikes and my power ring runs low	
come on, let's get a drink	
i don't drink	
yeah, well i do and when my wingman is carrying a green lantern lantern, i drink a lot	
i'll have a screwdriver, please	
don't be chintzy with the screw	
i would like a root beer float	
sheldon, they don't have ice cream	
they don't	
well, apparently, these people and i differ greatly on the definition of "party"	
he'll have a shirley temple	
and don't be chintzy with the shirley	
okay,	
let's check out the females	
all right	
there's a female	
that's professor wilkinson's wife	
she's like  years old	
but she's female	
isn't that the game no	
i'm looking for a hookup	
oh, yes	
so, the point of this exercise is for you to find someone to copulate with	
not so loud,	
but ideally, yes	
thanks	
thank you	
and what is my function as "wingman"	
you help me run my game	
okay what is your game	
when i lie through my teeth to a woman,	
you nod and agree	
hey, that's pretty cool	
what is it	
it's a limited edition green lantern lantern	
my friend is looking for someone to copulate with	
you're very funny	
i'm abby	
i'm sheldon how do you do	
rajesh ramayan koothrappali	
call me raj	
hi, raj	
where are you from	
the mysterious subcontinent of india	
ooh, india	
you know india i saw slumdog millionaire	
well, i'm a slumdog astrophysicist	
i thought your father was a gynecologist	
i'm sorry	
martha, come here	
meet raj and sheldon	
this is my friend, martha hi	
hello hello	
is that the limited edition green lantern lantern	
"in brightest day, in darkest night, no evil shall escape my sight"	
oh, that is so awesome	
thank you	
have you chosen one to copulate with	
so, what should we talk about	
well, we could always learn more about why people who believe in psychics are idiots	
leonard	
oh, we don't need to talk about that anymore	
leonard covered it pretty well in the car	
i'm sorry, but facts are facts	
right, and if you can't understand it, it's not a fact	
no, if it's not a fact, it's not a fact	
oh, got it thank you for educating me	
you're welcome	
how's your fish	
amazing	
would you like to try some	
yeah, sure well, the fact is, you can't	
come on, howard, bernadette, you're both scientists	
help me out here	
what do you think want to jump right in the middle of another couple's argument	
no, thank you	
sorry	
maybe we should just stop talking about this	
maybe some of us should	stop talking altogether	
how is everything tonight	
really uncomfortable	
you know, the best thing about being in a committed, monogamous, mutually supportive relationship is that even if you have different ideas, you can have a spirited debate, yet still care for, even make love with	
want your fish	
i knew you were going to do that	
doesn't make me psychic	
attaboy, leonard, make it worse	
american woman listen what i say	
what's going on	
we scored	
i'm the wingman	
american woman	
hey	
laser	
had a great night last night	
i don't like to kiss and tell, but somebody made it to eighth base	
what the hell is eighth base	
seventh base with shirt off well, my shirt	
how'd things go with penny	
oh couldn't be better	
are we taking	
our relationship frustrations out on innocent cylons	
it's not just cylons	
superman's next	
all right, i was going to try to squeeze in a little more mocking before lunch, but i can come back later when you don't have a highpowered weapon	
how can i go out with a woman who believes in psychics	
hey, i once dated a girl who believed she was abducted by aliens and that didn't bother you	
au contraire it meant she was gullible and open to a little probing	
what am i supposed to do, pretend i believe something I don't whenever i'm with penny	
hey, i'm sure penny fakes all kinds of things when she's with you	
do me a favor lean over,	
put your head right here	
let me show you another way to look at this	
here we have the universe of all women these are the ones you want to sleep with these are the women who believe exactly what you believe these are the women who would be willing to sleep with and right there in the little triple intersection is your ideal mate odds are she's a short physicist with low self esteem who lives in a government research facility in china	
what's your point	
in order to keep having a sexual relationship with penny, i have to give up everything i believe in my intellectual integrity, the very nature of who i am	
i can't do that, howard	
i respect that	
what is that	
your new girlfriend	
have fun tonight	
the dog	
koira	
the roof	
katto	
grapes	
ryp leet	
one minute	
sis  n	
what was that	
it means "come in"	
it's taking forever to load the new operating system on my computer	
i disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom, and now i thought i'd learn finnish	
that's hindi for ”whatever floats your boat"	
uh, listen, i got a text	
from that girl abby, and she and her friend martha want to hang out with us again what do you say	
i don't say anything i merely offer you a facial expression	
that suggests you've gone insane	
i don't get it you had a great time	
yes, exactly, i had a great time that's done i've moved on to other things for example, after i learn finnish, I'm not going to learn finnish again	
please, sheldon, i'm a lost indian boy	
far from home, and i want a girlfriend and i want her to be abby, and she'll only come over if she can bring martha	
raj, i highly doubt there is any argument you can make, threat you might levy, rhetorical strategy, plea, invocation, supplication, or vetoomus that you can employ that would convince me to reconsider	
my incredible hulk hands signed by stan lee	
oh, my i've admired these for years	
so does that mean we can go with the girls again	
hulk agree to second date with puny humans	
you can't wear the hands on the date	
hulk sad	
hey	
cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh	
not only is it courteous, it's safety smart every year, , fires are caused by accidental dryer lint ignition now you're supposed to say, "wow, what an interesting fact "come here, you crazy, nerdy guy i could never be mad at you"	
wow, that's all you got after you were the most obnoxious person on a double date that included howard wolowitz	
no, i'm sorry I really am it's not right to mock what a person believes in	
thank you would you be willing to go to my psychic and see what it's all about	
would you be willing to read a book that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds	
i would not	
okay, let's go see your psychic	
really	
well, yeah, one of us has to keep an open mind	
you saying i don't have an open mind	
no, nnot at all	
let me help you with this stuff	
you know, i believe in ghosts, too	
great and astrology	
i know, and pyramid power and healing crystals	
oh, no, no, no, crystals don't work	
really, that's the line	
psychics are real, but crystals are voodoo	
oh, voodoo's real you don't want to mess with voodoo	
flatland is more than just a mathematical essay	
it is also a treatise on victorian social mores	
you know, i had never considered that	
wow, that's going to completely change my visits there	
well, it's late	
uhhuh	
time for bed	
okay	
good night, puny human	
sheldon	
yes	
listen, they're kind of getting busy in the living room, and	
i was wondering if i could hang out in here for a while	
well, i suppose	
come in	
i'll sleep in leonard's room good night
