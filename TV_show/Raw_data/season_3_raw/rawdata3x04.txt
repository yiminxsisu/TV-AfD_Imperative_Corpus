this movie baffles me every time we watch it	
what do you mean	
the instructions are very clear	
"don't feed the gremlins after midnight "	
"don't get the gremlins wet "	
how hard is that	
hi, guys	
hi, honey	
hey	
ooh, we're "honey" now, are we	
yes since their relationship became carnal,	
penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment,	
thus distinguishing him	from those she calls "sweetie,"	
usually in an attempt to soften	a thinlyveiled insult	
you're boring people,	
sweetie	
although, sometimes,	
she omits the veil entirely	
so, what are you guys doing	
celebrating	
columbus day	
we're watching goonies, gremlins	
and young sherlock holmes	
they're all written by chris columbus	
okay	
what do you watch on thanksgiving	
the parade	
oh, you know,	
that reminds me	
i usually go back to nebraska for thanksgiving,	
but this year they're calling it off on account of my brother's trial	
what's he on trial for	
oh, just a big misunderstanding	
you know, you'd actually like my brother	
he's kind of a chemist	
anyway, i was thinking	
i'd have thanksgiving here,	
and you are all invited	
oh i'll be there	
will you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce	
i guess i could	
serve both	
you guess i don't seem to have much of a handle on this	
yeah, i really wish i could,	
penny, but every year,	
my mother has all the relatives over and cooks up her famous turbriskafil turbriskafil turkey stuffed with a brisket	
stuffed with gefilte fish	
it's not as good as it sounds	
raj, what about you	
oh, he usually comes	
to my house right, pal	
all right, this year,	
you don't have to eat the turbriskafil	
i don't even chew it	
i swallow it like pills	
so, what's going on	
with raj	
well, the good news is,	
he has no problem with my mother's turbruskafil	
hard to believe,	
but go on	
the bad news is,	
he says he's getting deported	
leonard	
what do you mean,	
he's getting deported	
i believe it means that the us government is going to expel him from the country	
he could then either return to his native india, emigrate to another country that's willing to accept him or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate	
personally, i'd choose pirate	
penny, would you mind stepping outside	
so we can speak to him	
fine	
but the man really needs to work on his girl issues	
another reason to consider a life of piracy	
even today, i understand	
that's an allmale profession	
okay, she's gone	
sorry	
i lost my cool	
so, what's going on	
okay, here's the deal	
six months ago, my research testing the predicted composition of transneptunian objects	ran into a dead end	
so	
so, my visa's only good as long as	
i'm employed at the university	
and when they find out at i've got squat, they're going to cut me off	
by the way, when i say squat, i mean diddlysquat	
i wish i had squat	
so, wait, what have you been doing for the past six months	
you know, checking email,	
updating my facebook status,	
messing up wikipedia entries	
hey, did you know netflix lets you stream movies on your computer now	
and you've continued to take the university's money under false pretenses	
highly unethical for an astrophysicist	
although practically mandatory for a pirate	
i don't want to go back	to india	
it's hot and loud,	
and there's so many people	
you have no idea	
they're everywhere	
okay, guys, think	
how do we keep raj in the country	
penny	
why doesn't he just get another job	
what are you asking me for	
i don't know if you can talk now or not	
oh, beef	
i'm going to miss you so much	
do you know, at the mumbai mcdonald's,	you can't get a big mac	all you can get	is a chicken maharaja mac	
and the special sauce	
curry which, in india,	
believe me,	
is really not that special	
don't worry,	
you'll find another job	
yeah let me start practicing for it	
"do you want fries with	that maharaja mac"	
sheldon	
hi, leonard	
hello, raj	
hello, sheldon	
forgive me, as you know, i'm no adept at reading facial cues,	
but i'm going to take a stab here	
you're either sad or nauseated	
i'm sad	
i was going to say sad	
i don't know why i hedged	
what are you eating	
elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce	
oh, beefaroni	
i think i'll miss you most of all	
i've always been a little confused about this	
why don't hindus eat beef	
we believe cows are gods	
not technically	
in hinduism, cattle are	thought to be like god	
do not tell me about my own culture	
in the mood i'm in, i'll take you out i swear to cow	
i'm sorry	
me, too	
i'm just	
i'm a little on edge	
understandable	
your entire life seems	to be crumbling around you,	
and your future	appears bleak at best	
thank you	
and you're wrong about hinduism and cows	
hey, raj, guess what	
professor laughlin is looking for someone to join the stellar evolution	research team	
you're kidding that's fantastic	
i know what are you waiting for	
call him and set up an interview	
i'm on it	
that's happy, right	
yeah	
nailed it	
dr koothrappali, come on in	
i was surprised to hear	
you were interested in joining our little team giving up on those transneptunian objects, are we	
no, no it's a very promising area	
in a perfect world i'd spend several more years on it	
but i just couldn't pass up the opportunity to work with you on your tremendously exciting	
and not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis	
splendid	
uh, please sit down	
can i offer you	a sherry	
it's a little early, isn't it	
not on proxima centauri	
that's very good	
jolly amusing,	
but if you don't mind,	i'll hold off until sunset on titan	
well done	
i have a feeling you're going to fit in just fine,	
dr koothrappali	
thank you, sir	
i'm sorry	
am i late	
no, no, no	
right on time	
dr koothrappali,	
may i present	
dr millstone from mit	
she'll be heading up our data analysis team	
it's nice to meet you,	
dr koothrappali	
i read your paper on kuiper belt object size distribution	
i really enjoyed it	
how did you correct for the selection bias	
well, i ran a simulation	
that allowed me	to correct for the observational efficiency	
that's just fascinating	
thank you	
would you like to hear more about it in my hot tub	
so, when do i start	
what do you mean you didn't get the job	
how could you not get it	
you know he's british	
i'm indian	
ever since gandhi,	
they haven't liked us very much	
wait, are you saying that	
he discriminated against you	
because we should file a complaint	
that's okay	
a complaint has been filed	
so, that's it	
that was my last hope	
i'm going to be deported,	
sent home in disgrace,	
exposed to the sardonic barb of my cousin sanjay	
or, as you may know him,	
dave from at&t customer service	
i'm really going to miss you	
will you come visit me in india	
gee, that's, like,	
a hour flight	
how about i meet you halfway	
halfway is  miles	
off the coast of japan	
tell you what,	
we'll skype	
gentlemen	
leonard	
hey, raj,	
did you get the job with professor laughlin	
no	
i assumed as much	
but never fear	
like the subordinate male protagonist	
in countless action movies	
who disappears half way	through the second reel,	
i have returned to save the day	
odd	
usually, he's met by cheers	
anyway,	
i was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations,	
and it occurred to me	
that i could benefit	
excuse me, sheldon	
how many reels before the subordine male protagonist gets to his point	
i'm sorry if you didn't	cheer at my entrance,	
it's too late to buy into the premise	
anyway, i got some extra money from the head of the department,	
and raj can come work for me	
you want me to work with you	
for me	
you're going to	have to listen more carefully when you're on the job	
ay, uh, please don't take this the wrong way,	
but i'd rather swim bucknaked across the ganges	with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow, agonizing death	from a viral infection	
than work with you	
for me	
sheldon, are you busy	
of course i'm busy	
shall i wait	
yes, please	
how may i help you	
i've reconsider your offer	
to let me work with you	
for me	
yes, for you	
i do, however, have	
a few conditions	
first, at all times, i am to be treated	as a colleague and an equal	
second, my contributions shall be noted	in all published material	
and third, you are never allowed to lecture me on hinduism or my indian culture	
i'm impressed, raj	
those are very cogent	
and reasonable conditions	
thank you	
i reject them all	
then you leave me no choice	
i accept the job	
i'm sorry, i believe	
you've misunderstood	
i'm not giving you the job	
i'm simply affording you	
the opportunity to apply for it	
have a seat we'll get started with the interview	
wha you're kidding	
please	
all right	
so 	
that's what you wear to an interview	
come on, dude,	
we've been friends for years	
oh, pulling strings, are we	
sheldon, for god's sakes,	
don't make me beg	
bazinga	
you've fallen victim	
to another one of my classic practical jokes	
i'm your boss now	
you may want to laugh at that	
ah, nice having the place to ourselves, isn't it	
uhhuh	
now that raj is	
working for sheldon,	
i don't have to chauffeur	
him around anymore	
plus, yeah, with them	
working late so much,	
we get some privacy	
mmhmm	
hey, want to get a little crazy	
what are you thinking	
let's slide over to sheldon's spot a make out	
you are a dirty girl	
oh, god, how did he know	
hello	
hi, howard	
am i interrupting	
little bit, yeah	
guess i should have called	
yeah, maybe	
tonight's the night	
i usually go line dancing	
with raj at the palomino	
uhhuh	
but he's working with sheldon	
yes, we know	
want me to leave	
you know, whatever	
okay, i guess i can hang for a little while	
so what are we watching	sex and the city	
yikes	
hey, i happen to love this movie	
fine, let's watch it	
maybe all our periods will synchronize	
all right, we're going to be designing an experiment to look for the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space	
ooh, dark matter	
we better bring	a flashlight	
i was making a joke	
i'm the boss	
i make the jokes	
sorry	
go ahead and make your joke	
this is not the	
time for joking	
we're doing serious research,	
which requires complete	and utter focus	
all right,	
let's buckle down and work	
sheldon	
what	
i need an aspirin	
top desk drawer	
thank you	
alright	
yes	
good	
that was fun	
thank you	
leonard, honey, you don't have to say thank you	every time we have sex	
oh okay	
tomorrow you're going to get a card in the mail	
just throw it away	
top o' the mornin' to ya	
what are you doing here	
well, usually, on sundays,	
i go with raj to scam on hippie chicks at the farmers market,	
but he's still working with sheldon,	
so i thought i'd come over here	
and make you guys scrambled eggs and salami	
it's the perfect meal for après i'amour	
oh, kill me	
by the way, i couldn't help overhearing your big finish	
bravo, leonard	
see, if you had killed me	
when i said "kill me,"	
i wouldn't have had to hear that	
what do you guys think	
want to take in a matinee, maybe go rollerblading, catch a step class	
do something	
okay	
um, howard, we need to talk	
sure 'sup, holmes	
uh please understand that it's not that we don't want you around,	
but penny and i	
occasionally need some	alone time	
oh	
i i get it, i'm the third wheel	
sorry, i should have seen that	
i'll get out	
of your way	
uh, you're gonna want to eat those eggs	while they're still hot	
thank you	
there's lox and cream cheese in the fridge	
the bagels are in the oven,	
i was  warming them up	
great	
i'm just going to hang out	
with my mom	
that's always fun	
good	
are we terrible people	
i don't know	
what do you	
want me to do	
get him	
bring him back	
are you sure	
yeah	
okay	
howard come back	
oh, you guys had me scared	
for a minute	
no, no, no, no	
that rate is much too low	
from what we'd expect	
from this collision	
do you understand	
we're talking about dark matter	colliding in outer space	
of course i understand	
and who are you to tell me about outer space	
i'm the astrophysicist	
"astro" means "space "	
"astor" means "star "	
okay, well, let	
me just tell you,	
if we were having this argument	in my native language,	
i'd be kicking your butt	
english is your native language	
okay, you got me there, but	
you're wrong about this	
there is a fine line between wrong and visionary	
unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it	
my god, you think	
that every thought that comes out of your head is pure gold	
well, let me tell you something	
some of those thoughts are pure cacacaca	
it means "doodoo"	
all right	
first of all,	
dr koothrappali,	
when i first proposed	
that you work with me	
aha so i am working with you	
in this context,	
"with me" means "for me"	
ah, well, in	
this context	
oh	
if i'm wrong,	
prove it	
okay	
here's where we derive the mass	of the dark matter particle	
you've misstated the atomic weight of the target	
let me finish	
you're defacing work	
i'm not defacing it,	
i'm fixing it	
give me the eraser	
no	
i said give it to me	
come and get it	
fine	
oh, lord	
dr koothrappali,	
as your superior, i forbid you from writing on my board	
you are not my superior	
i am in every way	
oh, yeah	
can you do this	
nice working with you	
i'm sorry for you	
raj	
raj raj	
i'm busy	
doing what	
all right,	
you've made your point	
what do you want, sheldon	
i looked over the board	
and it turns out	
you were right	
so you were wrong	
i didn't say that	
that's the only	logical inference	
nevertheless,	
i didn't say it	
anyway, i would like you to come back and work for me	
for you or with you	
in this context "for me"	
could mean "with me "	
all right, but i have some conditions	
i reject them all	
i'll take the job	
see you monday	
wait, you have to drive me home	
how did you get here	
i walked	
so walk home	
i can't	
there's a big dog outside on the way home,	
we can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector for  gev particles	
all right
