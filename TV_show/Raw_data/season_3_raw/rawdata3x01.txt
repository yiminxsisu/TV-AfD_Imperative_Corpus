i just want you both to know,	
when i publish my findings, i won't forget your contributions	
great	
thanks	
of course, i can't mention you in my nobel acceptance speech,	
but when i get around to writing my memoirs, you can expect a very effusive footnote	
and perhaps a signed copy	
we have to tell him	
tell me what	
damn his vulcan hearing	
you fellows are planning a party	
for me, aren't you	
okay, sheldon, sit down	
if there's going to be a theme,	
i should let you know	
that i don't care for luau, toga	
or "under the sea"	
yeah, we'll keep that in mind	
look	
we need to talk to you about something	
that happened at the north pole	
if this is about the night	
the heat went out,	
there's nothing to be	
embarrassed about	
it's not about that	
we agreed to never speak of it again	
so we slept together naked	
it was only to keep our core body	
temperatures from plummeting	
he's speaking about it	
for me, it was a bonding moment	
sheldon, you remember the first few weeks we were looking for magnetic monopoles and not finding anything and you were acting like an obnoxious, giant dictator	
we were gonna be gentle with him	
that's why i added the "tator"	
and when we finally	
got our first positive data,	
you were so happy	
in the world of emoticons,	
i was colon, capital "d"	
well, in actuality, what your equipment detected wasn't so much evidence of paradigmshifting monopoles as it was static from the electric can opener, we were turning on and off	
he just went colon, capital "o"	
you tampered with my experiment	
we had to	
it was the only way to keep you	
from being such a huge dickensian	
you see that i add the "ensian "	
did leonard know about this	
leonard's my best friend in the world	
surely leonard didn't know	
it was his idea	
of course it was	
the whole plan reeks of leonard	
i missed you so much	
i missed you, too	
i couldn't think of anyone else	
while you were gone	
me, neither	
except for one night	
when the heat went out	
long story don't ask	
do not make a sound	
whispering,	
"do not make a sound "	is a sound	
damn his vulcan hearing	
not a good time, sheldon	
oh, this is ridiculous	
what	
hello	
i realize you're currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urges, but as you have an entire lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you,	
may i interrupt this one	
great to see you too	
come on in	
wolowitz has informed me	
of your grand deception	
do you have anything	
to say for yourself	
yes, i feel terrible about it	
i will never forgive myself,	
i don't expect you to, either,	
and i would really appreciate it if you would leave me with penny	
for a session of selfcriticism	
and repentance	
can someone please tell me	
what's going on here	
what's going on is	
i was led to believe	
i was making groundbreaking strides in science,	when in fact, i was being fed false data at the hands	of wolowitz, koothrappali and your furry little boy toy	
is that true	
it was the only way	
to make him happy	
make him happy	
when he wasn't happy,	
we wanted to kill him	
there was even a plan	
we were going to throw	
his kindle outside,	
when he went to get it, lock the door	
and let him freeze to death	
that seems like a bit	
of an overreaction	
the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs to four different sled dog teams and yell, "mush "	
we kept the original data	
you can still publish	
the actual results	
yes, but the actual results	
are unsuccessful	
and i've already sent an email to everyone at the university explaining that i have confirmed string theory and forever changed man's understanding of the universe	
aw, see, yeah, you probably	
shouldn't have done that	
so write another email	
set the record straight no big deal	
you're right, leonard	
it's not a big deal	
all you did was lie to me, destroy my dream and humiliate me in front of the whole university	
that, fyi, was sarcasm	
i, in fact,	
believe it is a big deal	
the poor thing	
yeah, i feel terrible	
wait wait	
aren't you going to go talk to him	
he'll be fine the guy's a trouper	
come here	
you're right, you shouldn't talk to him	
i will	
man, i cannot catch a break	
do you want to talk	
about what	
being betrayed by my friends	
spending three months	
at the north pole for nothing	
and i didn't even get	
to go to comiccon	
oh, hon	
soft kitty, warm kitty	
that's for when i'm sick	
sad is not sick	
sorry	
i don't know your sad song	
i don't have a sad song	
i'm not a child	
you know, i do understand	
what you're going through	
really	
did you just have the nobel prize	
in waitressing stolen from you	
well, no, but when i was a senior in high school, one of my friends heard i was gonna be named head cheerleader i was so excited	
my mom even made me	
a celebration pie	
then they named stupid	
valerie mossbacher head cheerleader	
big ol' slutbag	
are you saying	
that you think a "celebration pie"	
is even remotely	
comparable to a nobel prize	
they're pretty tasty	
and on a different, but not unrelated topic, based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits, do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheerleader	
look, sheldon, i just don't think	
that the guys and leonard	
really meant to hurt you	
they just told an unfortunate lie	
to deal with a difficult situation	
you know what it's like	
remember that scene in the new star trek when kirk has to take over the ship, so he tells spock all that stuff he knew wasn't true, like saying spock didn't care his mom died	
i missed comiccon	
and the new star trek movie	
i like the new look	
thanks	
i call it "the clooney"	
i call it "the mario and luigi,"	
but whatever	
how's sheldon doing	
he came out of his room this morning wearing his darth vader helmet and tried to choke me to death with the force, so i'd say, "a little better"	
if i may abruptly change the subject,	
did you and penny finally you know	
personally, i don't care,	
but my genitals wanted me to ask	
tell your genitals what i do with penny	
is none of their business	
he says they didn't do it	
sheldon, over here	
what are you doing	
i feel bad for the guy	
sheldon, why are you	
sitting by yourself	
because i am without friends	
like the proverbial cheese,	
i stand alone	
even while seated	
come on we said we were sorry	
it's going to take more than an "i'm sorry" and a storebought apology pie from penny to make up for what you've done to me	
read your retraction email	
way to destroy your reputation	
you see	
people have been pointing	
and laughing at me all morning	
that's not true	
people have been pointing	
and laughing at you your whole life	
i've had enough	
attention, everyone	
i'm dr sheldon cooper	
as many of you in the physics department might know, my career trajectory has taken a minor detour	
off a cliff	
my credibility	
may have been damaged	
completely wrecked	
but i would like to remind you that in science,	there's no such thing as failure	
there once was a man who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant as the single "biggest blunder" of his career	
that man's name was	
surprise, surprise	
albert einstein	
yeah, but research into dark energy proved that einstein's cosmological constant was actually right all along, so you're still surprise, surprise a loser	
you think you're so clever	
let me just tell you, while i do not currently have a scathing retort, you check your email periodically for a doozy	
so much for our friendship with sheldon	
we'll always have the night	
the heat went out	
since we got interrupted last night,	
i didn't have a chance	
to give you this	
you shouldn't have	
oh, boy	
what is it	
it's a snowflake	
from the north pole	
are you serious	
it's eternal	
i preserved it in a one percent solution	
of polyvinyl acetal resin	
that's the most romantic thing	
anyone's ever said to me	
that i didn't understand	
it's actually a simple process	
cyanoacrylates are monomers	
which polymerize on	
red alert, leonard	
sheldon ran away	
man, i cannot catch a break	
so, how do you know he ran away	
well, he's not answering his phone,	
he handed in his	
resignation at the university	
and he sent me a text	
that said, "i'm running away"	
thanks for letting me know	
aren't you going to do something	
of course i'm going to do something	
howard, you check the comic book store	
raj, go to the thai restaurant	
i'll stay here with penny	
in her apartment	
oh, damn it	
it's sheldon's mother	
a break cannot be caught	
hi, mrs cooper	
he is	
sheldon went home to texas	
yeah, no, i know he resigned	
i guess it kind of is our fault	
no, you're right	
someone needs to come talk to him	
don't worry, i'll take care of it	
all right	
new plan	
howard, you and raj go to texas	
i'll stay with penny in her apartment	
you're not gonna go with them	
well, you know,	
i gave you the snowflake	
and we were kissing and	
come on,	
i don't want to go to texas	
oh, right, and i do	
my people already crossed a desert once	
we're done	
trust me, you'll be fine see ya	
well, wait a second, leonard	
come on, how can you not go	
he's your best friend	
yeah, but i already saw him naked	
just come here	
i promise i will be here	
when you get back	
just go help sheldon	
really	
yeah	
we waited a few months	
we can wait a few more days	
maybe you can	
go	
boy, you cannot	
catch a break, can you	
here you go, shelly	
thanks, mom	
hold your horses, young man	
here in texas,	
we pray before we eat	
aw, mom	
this is not california,	
land of the heathen	
gimme	
by his hand we are all	
fed	
give us, lord, our daily bread	
please know that we are truly grateful	
for every cup and every	
plateful	
now, that wasn't so hard, was it	
my objection was based on considerations other than difficulty	
whatever	
jesus still loves you	
thank you for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich	
oh, i know how to take care of my baby	
his eyes came out a little thin, but you can just pretend he's chinese	
so, do you want to talk about what happened with you and your little friends	
they're not my friends	
all right	
if you recall, when you were little,we sat right here at this very spot	and we talked about the problems	
you had getting along with the neighbor kids	
that was different	
they were threatened by my intelligence and too stupid to know	
that's why they hated me	
oh baby, they knew very well	
why they hated you	
i can't believe	
you bought a red cowboy hat	
hello	
i'm wearing a red turtleneck	
plus, it was the only boys' large	
they had	
i'm sorry,	
this does not look like texas	
where's the tumbleweeds	
whe's the saloons	
saloons	
like in the movies, i saw growing up in india	
you know, four for texas,	
yellow rose of texas	
this neighborhood is more texas chainsaw massacre	
i was really hoping to see a cattle drive	
what can i tell you they probably have steaks on sale at that bigass costco over there	
will you please take that stupid hat off	
no, i want to blend in	
to what toy story	
hi, boys	
howdy, ma'am	
howdy to you, too	
you got here quick	
we took the redeye	
well, come on in	
thank you kindly	
can i get you something to drink	
no, thank you	
if y'all don't mind,	
i got a hankerin' for a lone star beer	
there's no alcohol in this household	
stop talking like that and lose the hat	
sorry i'll take a diet yoohoo	
if you have it	
you'll take a cola	
what about you	
radge, isn't it	
you still having trouble talking to the ladies	
because, at our church,	we have a woman	who's an amazing healer	
mostly she does	crutch and wheelchair people,	
but i bet she'd be willing	
to take a shot at whatever third world demon is running around inside of you	
if you don't mind, there's a  nonstop back to los angeles and you have no idea how much i want to be on it	
a girl	
uh, yes, ma'am	
oh, good	
i been praying for you	
what are they doing here	
we came to apologize	
again	
and bring you home	
why don't you pack up your stuff and we'll head back	
no, this is my home now	
thanks to you, my career is over	
and i will spend the rest of my life here in texas trying to teach evolution	to creationists	
you watch your mouth, shelly	
everyone's entitled to their opinion	
evolution isn't an opinion, it's fact	
and that is your opinion	
i forgive you	
let's go home	
don't tell me prayer doesn't work	
how about that	
i finally caught a break	
you know how they say	
when friends have sex, it can get weird	
sure	
why does it have to get weird	
i don't know	
i mean,	we were friends, and now we're more than friends	
we're whatever "this" is	
but why label it, right	
i mean	
it is what it is and	
leonard it's weird	
totally
