so two years later, there's a knock on the door, guy opens it, and there on his porch is the snail, who says, "what the heck was all that about"	
i don't really get it	
well, see, it took two years for the snail to, not important	
can i ask you a question	
sure	
where do you think this is going	
to be honest, i was hoping at least second base	
you're so funny you're like a standup comedian	a jewish standup comedian,	
that'd be new	
actually, i think a lot of them are jewish	
no, i was just	
never mind	
look, howard, this is our third date and we both know what that means	
we do	
sex	
you're kidding	
but i need to know whether you're looking for a relationship or a one night stand	
okay, just to be clear there's only one correct answer, right	
it's not like "chicken or fish" on an airplane maybe you need to think about it a little	
you know, it's not unheard of for a one night stand to turn into a relationship	
call me when you figure it out	
three dates means sex who knew	
greetings, homies	
homette	
why are you back from your date so early	
in romance, as in show business, always leave them wanting more	
what exactly does that mean	
he struck out	
hey, did either of you guys know that three dates with the same woman is the threshold for sex	
actually, i've never had three dates with the same woman	
with penny and me, it took two years now that i think about it, that was three dates	
okay, well, before you and penny hooked up, did she ask for any kind of commitment	
no, she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open	
i have something to announce, but out of respect for convention, i will wait for you to finish your current conversation	
what are you talking about	
the cultural paradigm in which people have sex after three dates	
i see	
now, are we talking "date", the social interaction, or "date", the dried fruit	
never mind,	
what's your announcement	
oh, good, my turn well, this is very exciting and i wanted you to be among the first to know	
hey, cooper i hear you're going to be on the radio with ira flatow from science friday next week	
thank you, kripke, for depriving me of the opportunity	
to share my news with my friends	
my pleasure	
my "thank you"	was not sincere	
but "my pleasure" is	
let me ask you a question at what point	did national public radio have to start scraping the bottom of the barrel for its guests	
don't answer	
it's rhetorical	
why are you such a stupid head	
that is also rhetorical	
i'm sorry you had to hear that	
are you really going to be on npr	
yes, they're interviewing me by phone from my office, regarding the recent so called "discovery"	 of magnetic monopoles in spinices it's pledge week and they're trying to goose the ratings with a little controversy	
very cool,	
congratulations	
thank you	
my mother is very excited she's convening her bible study group to listen in, and then pray for my soul	
i was on the radio once	
i called in to fever  fm new delhi	and was the fourth person to say the phrase that pays "fever , aajke naye acchha sangeetka ghar" that means "fever , home of the really good current music" it's much catchier	 in hindi	
all right these are the talking points for my npr interview tomorrow i need to make sure that they're simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand howard, look this over and tell me what's unclear to you	
excuse me, i have a master's degree in engineering from the massachusetts institute of technology it required the completion of units of grad work and an original thesis	
yes	
look this over and tell	me what's unclear to you	
you know, when Sheldon gives you homework,	
you don't have to do it	
in fact, it's better if you don't, otherwise it makes the rest of us look bad	
hi, guys	
hello	
yo, raj, talk to me	
i'm sorry,	
just screwing with you	
hey, howard, why haven't you called bernadette	
did she say something	
yeah, she said she hasn't heard from you in a week	
i thought you liked her	
i do, but she wants a commitment and i'm not sure she's my type	
she agreed to go out with you for free what more do you need	
look, bernadette is really nice i just always thought when i finally settle down into a relationship, it would be with someone, you know, different	
different how	
well, you know, more like megan fox from transformers or katee sackhoff from battlestar galactica	
are you high	
you'd have a better shot with the three breasted martian hooker from total recall	
okay, now you're just being unrealistic anyway, that movie was like  years ago imagine how saggy those things would be	
howard, you're going to throw away a great girl like Bernadette because you're holding out for some ridiculous fantasy	
hey, just because you settled doesn't mean i have to	
excuse me,	
i'm sitting here	
hey, i did not settle for leonard i mean, obviously, he isn't the kind of guy i usually go out with you know, physically	
again, i'm right here	
my point is, i do not judge a book by its cover i am interested in the person underneath	
i am here, right you see me	
hey, i'm interested in what's inside people, too, but why is it wrong to want those insides wrapped up in, say, the delicious caramel that is halle berry	
yes, you're delicious caramel, too	
all right, you know what, i will tell you why it's wrong	
excuse me, may i interject	
what	
biologically speaking, howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line	
thank you, sheldon	
now, whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is, of course, an entirely different question	
this is ira flatow and you're listening to npr's science Friday joining us today by phone from his office in pasadena, California is dr sheldon cooper	
oh, this is going to be a riot	
thanks for being with us today, dr cooper	
my pleasure, ira	
now, let's talk about magnetic monopoles can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is	
of course first, consider an ordinary magnet which has, as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles a north and south pole if you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole	
uh, dr cooper, i think there might be something wrong with our connection	
no, i hear you fine as i was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles the primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole a requirement for string theory, or mtheory, if you will, the existence of such monopoles i, myself, led an expedition to the arctic circle in search of said particles	
kripke, i found the nozzle	
i'm going to kill you	
so nice you could join me this evening	
you're looking lovely as always	
thanks, howard	
always nice to be part of your masturbatory fantasies	
come on, katee	
don't make it sound so cheap	
i'm sorry, fiddling with yourself in the bathtub is a real class act	
thank you	
so, shall we get started	
sure	
but can i ask you a question first do you want to play	
cylon and colonist	
no	
i want to know why you're playing make believe with me when you could be out with a real woman tonight	
you mean, bernadette	
no, i mean princess leia of course i mean Bernadette she's a wonderful girl and she really likes you	
i know, but she's not you	
i'm not me	
the real me is in beverly hills going out with a tall, handsome, rich guy really tall sixfour	
ouch	
the point is, you've got a wonderful girl in your life, and you're ignoring her in order to spend your nights in the bathtub with a mental image and a wash cloth	
howard	
what are you doing in there	
i'm taking a bath	
i hope that's all you're doing we share that tub	
don't remind me	
oh, man all soaped up and no place to go	
how ya doin', buddy	
i was humiliated on national radio how do you think i'm doing	
come on, it wasn't that bad	
what do you want	
we represent the lollipop guild, and we want you	
okay, so kripke played a joke on you	
it wasn't funny	
i thought it was funny	
raj	
you laughed	
did you laugh	
i fell on the floor	
all right, he got you you can get him back	
i refuse to sink to his level	
you can't sink with all that helium in you, lucky you don't float away	
are you really admitting defeat	
i never admit defeat	
good	
however, on an unrelated topic, i am never getting out of this bed again	
what if you could make kripke look even sillier than he made you look	
i don't think that's possible, dude	
you're not helping	
i didn't come to help, i came to mock	
sheldon, what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on kripke,	
like, uh, like, how the joker got back at batman for putting him in the arkham asylum for the criminally insane	
that's true he didn't just stay there and talk about his feelings with the other psychotic villains he, he broke out and poisoned gotham's water supply	
well i suppose i could poison kripke	
no no it's a simple matter	
there are several toxic chemicals that'd be untraceable in an autopsy	
okay, uh, that's the spirit, but, um, let's dial it back to a nonlethal form of vengeance	
oh	
how about we put a whoopee cushion on his office chair he'll sit down, it'll sound like he's flatulent, even though he's not	
let's keep thinking	
oh, gee, you're too late scarlett johansson and wonder woman were just in here trolling around for neurotic, little weasels	
i came to talk to Bernadette she's working today, right	
yes, but i don't think she wants to see you	
why not	
come on, howard you hurt her feelings by not calling her all week plus, i've kind of been talkin' some smack about ya	
hello, howard	
wait, bernadette,	
i need to talk to you	
i can't now, i'm working	
this will only take a second you asked me to think about where our relationship was going, and i did Bernadette will you marry me	
is this more comedy that i don't understand	
no i'm serious i'm never going to find another girl like you who likes me and is know, real	
so, this isn't a joke	
no	
then you're insane	
i prefer to think of myself as quirky	
howard, we've only been on three dates we haven't even had sex yet	
fair enough when's your break	
wow	
don't you just hate it when this happens	
wow	
all right, how's this for revenge a solution of hydrogen peroxide, and one of saturated potassium iodide	
what's this	
mountain dew	
ahh, refreshing	
now, we're going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap, creating a little exothermic release of oxygen foamy vengeance	
yes, exactly this is brilliant, sheldon	
how are we going to deploy it in kripke's office	
already taken care of	
observe	
this is a live shot of kripke's lab via a mini webcam i was able to install, thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitor's shirt pocket at the same time, i also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling	
oh, sheldon,	
you remind me of a young lex luthor	
you flatter me, sir	
let me guess motion sensors	
yes	
the reaction will be triggered when kripke reaches the center of the room mwah, ha, ha	
i gotta say, i am really impressed	
this is truly the sheldon cooper way to get even	
it may be lowtech, but i still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity	
here comes kripke who is that with him	
i believe that's the president of the university and the board of directors	
abort abort	
there is no "abort"	
how could you not put in an "abort"	
i made a booboo, all right	
i think the board will really appreciate well we're using that nsa grant, president seibert	
right here we have a microcontrolled plasma	
wow looks like the ganges on laundry day	
at least they don't know it was you	
hello, kripke this classic prank comes to you from the malevolent mind of sheldon cooper if you'd like to see the look on your stupid face, this video is being instantly uploaded to youtube oh, and a hat tip to leonard Hofstadter and raj koothrappali for their support and encouragement in this enterprise	
well, i'm going back to india	
what's your plan	
hey, here's your tip from table seven	
oh, thanks	
mmhmm	
testing check check two	
oh, now what	
you want me to throw him out	
no, that's okay	
are you sure he's small i bet i can get a nice, tight spiral on him	
i want to dedicate this number to a great gal who i've done wrong Bernadette i am so sorry for trying to propose to you Bernadette you found it creepy but that's just the kind of thing i do	
ahh	
i know now it was too soon to talk of love it was just a crazy idea that came to me in my tub but, Bernadette, give me one more chance sweet Bernadette i'll get the hang of this thing they call romance, sweet Bernadette i dream to once again kiss your lips, sweet Bernadette sincerely yours howard wolowitz	
bernadette oh, i am so sorry	
are you kidding that's the most romantic thing anyone's ever done for me	
bernadette	
thank you, cheesecake factory
