sheldon, you’re wrong	
wolverine was not born with bone claws	
howard, you know me to be a very smart man	
don’t you think	if i were wrong, i’d know it	
okay, first of all	
give it up, dude	
you’re arguing	with a crazy person	
i’m not crazy	
my mother had me tested	
hey, guys	
what are you doing here	
what do you mean	
it’s new comic book night	
yeah, but since you and penny finally hooked up, we thought you two would be having bouncy naked yumyum night	
there’s more to life	
than sex, raj	
okay, who had "leonard flames out with penny in less than  hours"	
i did	
nothing flamed out	
we don’t have to have sex	
every night, you know	
you don’t have to,	
but it’s highly recommended	
yeah, take advantage of that window of opportunity before it slams shut	on your little dinky	
it’s not a matter of opportunity	
we’re getting to know each other	
there’s a learning curve	
what’s there to learn	
you get naked, do nasty things to each other,	
then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami	
easy peasy	
perhaps what leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction	
okay, who had "leonard gets a floppy disk"	
oh, a clever	
albeit obsolete, euphemism for insufficient blood flow	to the male sex organ	
nothing like that happened,	
all right	
the sex was just fine	
just fine	
oh, dude, the fourth harry	
potter movie was "just fine"	
i’m not saying it was bad	
i’m just saying it	
wasn’t great	
okay, when you say "it wasn’t great,"	
do you mean for both of you	
because we can totally see it not being great for her	
am i right	
oh, yeah	
to tell you the truth,	
i think we were both a little	
i don’t know	
disappointed let down ashamed horrified	repulsed	
all i know is, it wasn’t the way i dreamed it would be	
sex is never the way	
idream it’s gonna be	
because in your dreams	
you’re a horse from the waist down	
excuse me,	
wolverine origin	
miniseries issue two, page	
retractable bone claws	
if you people spent less time thinking about sex and more time concentrating on comic books,	we’d have far fewer of these embarrassing moments	
sheldon, dinner’s here	
sheldon	
tandoori palace	
no, we went somewhere new	
you’re goodnaturedly	
ribbing me, aren’t you	
no, look, mumbai palace	
why	
why would we change	
we had a perfectly good palace	
tandoori palace is our palace	
trust me, this will be just fine	
you are the authority on "just fine"	
what’s that supposed to mean	
yeah, exactly	
"not bad, but not great"	
what are they talking about	
i don’t know	
i know	
as i’m sure	
you’re aware	
duhduhduhduh	
duhduh	
if that’s morse code, that’s terrible	
as i was saying, you and leonard had sexual encounter a disappointing	
earlier this evening, leonard characterized it as "just fine"	
so what you’re seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed	
okay, yeah, well,	
i’m just gonna go eat my dinner elsewhere	
maybe an airplane headed for a mountainside	
penny, wait	
aah	
what is wrong with you	
i sense i may have crossed	
some sort of line	
yeah, you	
no, don’t tell him	
let’s see if he can figure it out	
ugh, i am so embarrassed	
please don’t be mad	
what did you tell them	
nothing bad, just that	
last night was fine	
fine you said it was fine	
yeah, it’s a perfectly	
good word	
you put it in front of "wine" or "dining," and you’ve really got something	
okay, well, let me ask you this	
how was last night for you	
it was okay	
okay	
yeah, it’s a perfectly	
good word	
i mean, you put it in front of "dokay" and you really got something	
all right, look,	
let’s not overreact, you know	
for a lot of couples, it takes time to get to know each other’s rhythms learn what the other person wants and likes	
so, you’ve been through this before	
no	
okaydokay	
you know, i think this is	
one of those things where talking about it is not going to make it better	
want a glass of wine	
so much	
okay	
see, we should’ve	
done this last night	
you know, have a little wine,	
take the edge off	
actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells and	stimulates reuptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like gammaaminobutyric acid	
don’t talk, just drink	
no, you’re misunderstanding	
a shiksa goddess isn’t an actual goddess	
and we don’t pray to them	
we prey on them	
whatever, dude	
the point is, leonard’s	
got one and you don’t	
is this it	
it was inappropriate to discuss	leonard and penny’s sex life in front of leonard and penny	
oh, good	
now i can eat	
what’s that	
sounds like a cricket	
hang on	
based on the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature in this room,	
it is a snowy tree cricket	
oh, give me a freakin’ break	
how could you possibly know that	
in , emile dolbear determined that there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket	
and the ambient temperature a precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets	
how do you know what the exact temperature of the room is	
under the terms of my roommate agreement with leonard,	
i’ve had unilateral control of the thermostat	
ever since the sweaty night of ’	
okay, you were right about wolverine and bone claws,	
but you’re wrong about the cricket	
howard, don’t embarrass	yourself	
the science chirps for itself	
humorous word play	
no, no, not this time	
i know insects, my friend	
i spent many childhood years capturing them with nets, putting them in glass jars, sticking pins through them, mounting them on corrugated cardboard with dymo labels underneath, identifying the genus and species in latin	
oh, dude, you are never	getting a shiksa goddess	
that is a snowy tree cricket	
oecanthus fultoni	
i was done with latin by fifth grade	
okay, okay, tell you what	
i am willing to bet anything	
that’s an ordinary	
field cricket	
i can’t take your money	
what’s the matter, you chicken	
i’ve always found that	an inappropriate slur	
chickens are not, by nature,	
at all timid	
in fact, when i was young,	
my neighbor’s chicken got loose	
and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house	chickens can’t climb trees	
thank god	
okay,	
i believe a chicken made you his bitch	
but the cricket thing, i don’t buy	
bet me	
fair enough	
what stakedo you propose	
i will put up my fantastic four number , first appearance of silver surfer against your flash , the classicflash of two worlds issue	
all right, you have a wager	
hmm	
great	
now how are you going to	
settle it, hmm	
there is no way	to determine the species of the cricket	without examining it	
i wonder what the nonpathetic	
people are doing tonight	
more wine	
hit me	
i don’t see anything	
shh	
hallway	
one at a time	
what was that	
my stomach	
indian food doesn’t agree with me	
ironic, isn’t it	
shh	
elevator shaft	
help me open it	
are you crazy	
we can’t go down an empty elevator shaft	
fine, if you don’t want to proceed, then you forfeit the bet,	
and i’ll take possession of your fantastic four	
let’s open her up	
are you bothered that i can so easily manipulate you	
don’t push me, sheldon	
i may be small, but i took kung fu when i was ,	
and i remember a good deal of it	
oh, really	
well, i grew up	with an older brother	
and a very contentious twin sister	
and i believe i could easily best you in any physical confrontation	
be it noogies, swirlies	or the classic	
"why are you hitting yourself"	
ooh, big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken	
what are we drinking now	
peppermint schnapps	
why would you buy peppermint schnapps	
because i like peppermint,	
and it’s fun to say schnapps	
hey, leonard	
what	
schnapps	
schnapps	
you’re right	
, that is fun	
be careful	
sheldon	
if i were not being careful, your telling me to be careful	
would not ke me careful	
stairwell	
sheldon	
uhoh, flashlight went out	
i need some batteries	
fellas	
hello	
it’s really dark down here	
oh, sweetie	
you really can’t hold	
your liquor, can you	
i’m okay	
just a little mouthwash,	
and then i’m gonna rock your world	
are you okay	
ugh, toby, what did you do in a past life to be so disgusting now	
his name isn’t toby	
toby is an absurd name	for a cricket	
what would you name him	
an appropriate cricket name	
for example, jiminy	
all right,	
sheldon, here we go	
kleingast’s field guide	to north american insects	
hey, toby	
right here	
see it	
the common field cricket, aka gryllus assimilis, which is latin	for "suck it, you lose"	
hang on	
voil	
the snowy tree cricket aka oecanthus fultoni, which is latin for i’ll suck nothing	
of course i’m joking	
because the latin for that	
isnihil exsorbibo	
that is not toby,	
this is toby	
raj, what do	
you think	
oh, i really don’t care anymore	
god, i had the most	
horrible night	
what happened	
obviously another carnal fiasco	
with the shiksi goddess	
shiksa shiksa	
forgive me	
yiddish was not spoken	
in east texas	
and if it was, it wasn’t spoken for long	
yeah, fine, whatever	
the point is,	
you’re wrong again	
we haven’t established that i’m wrong once	
all right	
tell you what	
let’s go down to the entomology department and let professor crley tell us	what kind of cricket toby is	
sheldon	
he’s a snowy tree cricket,	
and his name is jiminy	
i bet i could throw a rock in this room	
and come up with three better friends	
holy crap	
it’s like silence of the lambs down here	
don’t do that	
you’re such a girl	
they’re just bugs	
yeah, well,	
i don’t like bugs, okay	
they freak me out	
interesting	
you’re afraid of insects and women	
ladybugs must render	
you catatonic	
it was a joke	
i made it to lessen	
your discomfort	
you’re welcome	
don’t knock	
just walk in	
why be polite to the world’s leading expert on the dung beetle	
excuse me,	
are you professor crawley	
who wants to know	
i’m dr cooper from the physics department	
couldn’t wait, huh	
i’m sorry	
i haven’t even packed yet,	
and you’re already measuring my lab for one of your godless laser machines	
no, you don’t understand	
we just want to ask you	a question	
let me ask you one first	
what’s a world renowned	entomologist with a doctorate and years of experience to do with his life	when the university cuts off the funding for his lab, huh	
ask rhetorical questions that make people uncomfortable	
what’s your deal	
are they planning to outsource my job to bangalore	
i’m from new delhi	
maybe you should find another entomologist	
no, no we’re here	
let’s settle this	
professor, can you identify our cricket	
of course i can	
i can identify every insect and arachnid on the planet	
not that	
that’s going to keep me from having to move in with my daughter in oxnard	
and we’re not talking oxnard at the beach no	
we’re talking oxnard in the onion fields	
well, could you	look at toby	
toby	
what a stupid name	
for a cricket	
told ya	
it’s a field cricket	
yes	
no, no, wait	
dr crawley, are you sure	
young man, i’ve been studying insects since i was eight years old	
you know what they used to call me in school	
creepy crawley	
cruel as that may be,	
that is not in itself a credential	
let me show you something	
see that	
that’s a crawley’s dung beetle	
i discovered it after spending six months slogging through a bornean rain forest, while my wife was back home shacking up with a twobit	ornithologist who lives on a sailboat and likes to wear	bootcut jeans	
so, when i tell	
you that that’s a common field cricket,	you can take that to the damn bank	
cause god knows i can’t	
well, apparently,	
i was wrong	
congratulations	
enjoy oxnard	
i’m sure your daughter’s looking forward to having you	
oh, hey, sheldon	
what you got there	
a new comic book	
old comic book	
i just retrieved it from my safe deposit box	
what do you have a safe	deposit box for	old comic books	
i lost this to wolowitz	in an illconsidered cricket wager	
what, do they have	
wii cricket now	
that can’t be very popular	
penny, i’d rather not talk about it	
well, if it makes you feel any better,	
i’m not feeling so hot either	
why would that make me feel better	
i don’t know, empathy	
anyway, i’m just saying,	
that you’re feeling upset about something with howard,	
and i’m upset about something with leonard	
yes,	
yes, the disappointing sex	
that’s an inexact parallel	
you and leonard can always return to being friends,	
whereas i can never return to a state in which wolowitz	has not bested me like mrs riley’s chicken	
what’s mrs riley’s chicken	
a chicken that was owned by mrs riley	
okay, forget the chicken	
well, i wish i could	
no, no	
you may be right about me and leonard	
of course i’m right	
what are the odds i’d be wrong twice in one week	
no, i mean, we can always go back to being friends	
i just said that	
this conversation has started to circle	meeting adjourned	
hello	
hey	
what’s going on	
oh, you’d like to catch up on the events of the day all right	
well, there was a halfhour wait	at the bank to get into my safe deposit box,	
i was forced to talk to penny about your sexual problems,	
and, oh, yes,	
in a moment filled with biblical resonance, pride wenteth before my fall, causing my flash to goeth to wolowitz	
wait a minute	
you talked to penny	
about our sex life	
leonard, it astonishes me	
how you continually fixate on the trivial	
i lost a bet to wolowitz	
right, right	
you’re saying you talked to penny	
yeyes	
interesting	
hardly	
excuse me	
have i crossed some sort of line again	
little bit	
hmm	
ah, who cares	
oh, hey	
hey	
uh, what did sheldon	
say to you	
not a lot	
just that we always have the option of going back to being friends	
is that what you want	
i don’t know	
i mean, you have to admit things seemed simpler when we were just friends	
i guess	
it would take the pressure off	
it would, wouldn’t it	
so, we’ll just be friends	
good	
good	
come here	
hmm	
okaydokey
