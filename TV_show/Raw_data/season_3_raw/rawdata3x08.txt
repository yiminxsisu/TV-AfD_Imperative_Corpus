how much time do we have	
uh, tminus five hours,	minutes	to onset of meteor shower	
okay, our position is  degrees north,	
west	
that means the azimuth should be degrees relative to magnetic north with an elevation of	
anything yet	
uh, we have a signal,	
but there's no frame lock	
ha how about now	
we did it	
we have the west	
coast feed of hbo	
ooh, real sex	
big deal every time	
i watch that show	
all right, let's see	
what's on the east coast feed	
oh, hey dune	
not a great movie,	
but look	
at that beautiful desert	
too bad sheldon	
couldn't come with us	
oh it's just not the same without him	
oh, this sucks	
i'm switching back to real sex	
sheldon's log	
star date	
while my colleagues are off observing the leonid meteor shower,	
i have remained behind to complete my paper on the decays of highly excited massive string states	
although my research is going well	
i do miss the warmth of human companionship	
hahaha	
and good evening to you,	
siam palace	
this is sheldon cooper	
yeah, i'm going to be	
dining alone this evening,	
so i'll be reducing	
my usual order	
i'd like to start	
with one quarter of the assorted appetizers plate	
and, uh, one half of the golden treasure for two	
oh, for heaven's sake	
in the midth century,	
king rama iv of siam divided a huge empire amongst the colonial powers of europe	
in order to preserve his throne	
surely, you,	
his cultural descendant,	
can handle pad thai and dumplings	
sheldon help	
i need to go	
but you keep in mind that my sharply worded comments on yelp.com recently took down	
a local muffin store	
penny penny penny	
come in hurry	
penny	
i'm back here	
penny penny penny	
oh, for god's sakes,	
i'm in the bathroom	
shall i come back	
at a better time	
get in here hurry	
don't you dare knock	
hello	
i slipped in the shower,	
and i think i dislocated my shoulder	
not surprising	
you have no safety mat	
or adhesive stickers	
to allow for purchase on a surface	
with a low coefficient of static friction	
what	
tubs are slippery	
i know i slipped	
i have a series of whimsical duck stickers on the bottom of my tub	
yeah, okay, whatever	
will you just turn the water off	
and help me up	
they're holding	
umbrellas	
what	
the ducks in my tub	
uhhuh	
they're whimsical because ducks	
have neither the need for	
nor the ability to use umbrellas	
oh, my god i got to go to the emergency room	
well, assuming you're correct	
that your right humerus	is no longer seated in the glenoid socket,	
i would certainly think so	
okay, can you drive me	
i don't drive	
well, i can't drive	
well, it seems we've reached	
an impasse	
ow	
i could call you a cab	
or an ambulance	
no, no, no	
i can't wait that long	
you got to help me, please	
all right let it never be said	
that sheldon lee cooper	ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress	
no one's saying that	
let's go	
well, it does seem rather ironic	
that for want of cent adhesive ducks,	
we both might die	
in a fiery car crash	
i wish penny didn't for want	
didn't have to work	
she loves camping	
yeah, that would	
have been great	
you and penny having sex	
in the tent	
while i sit out here	
and watch howard hump a cactus	
okay, the best i can tell,	
there are eight other campsites nearby	
mostly science nerds like us,	
but just over yon	
ridge are two	
not unattractive	
middle school teachers	
who reek of desperation	
wow wonderful	
how old are they	
oh i don't know ,	
oh, menopause	
nature's birth control	
come on	
you guys can't be that hard up	
i am	
yeah, me, too	
look they gave me homemade cookies	
of course, they did	
that's what grandmothers do	
so, what are we waiting for	
relax	
i said we'd stop by a little later	
after they have their nap	
good idea	
they'll be refreshed	
cookie	
yeah thank you	
not bad	
yeah, very tasty	
well, so tell me more	
about these teachers	
not much to tell	
they had a vw microbus	
and were wearing tiedyed	
grateful dead shirts	
huh	
mmm	
good cookies	
i see no organizational	
system in here whatsoever	
which panties do you wear on mondays	
i don't need panties	
i just need shorts	
and a shirt	
my mother always told me one	
should wear clean underpants	
in case one is in an accident	
one was already in an accident	
that doesn't mean one	
won't be in another,	
especially if i'm driving	
clothes, sheldon	
i need clothes	
okay	
here	
seriously	
those shorts with that top	
all right	
no	
no	
oh, that's cute	
we should have you checked for a concussion	
okay	
now, you got to help me put these on	
all right	
but don't look	
don't look	
i don't want you	
to see me naked	
oh	
well, that's understandable	
you may be interested to know	
that a prohibition against looking is well established	
in heroic mythology	
uh, lot and his wife,	
perseus and medusa,	
orpheus and eurydi	
yeah, great	
they always look it never ends well	
ok, now you gotta help me get my arm into the sleeve	
ok	
is that my arm	
it doesn't feel	
like an arm	
then, maybe you should let it go	
all righty	
stars are pretty, aren't they	
up above the world so high,	
like little diamonds in the sky	
that's beautiful, dude	
you should	
you should write that down	
before someone steals it	
so, when do the meteors get here	
the meteors don't get here	
the earth is moving into their path	
i can feel it	
i can feel	
the earth moving	
it's moving too fast	
raj, slow it down	
okay, how's that	
better thanks	
stars are pretty,	
aren't they	
what's so funny	
it's your american accent	
everything you say sounds stupid	
"stars are pretty, aren't they"	
for the record, i should let you know	
this is my first time driving an actual motor vehicle	
you have your learner's permit, right	
yes, and i have logged a considerable number of hours on a simulator	
good	
didn't work out well	
all right,	
can we please go	
one moment	
according to my driver's ed book,	
a side mirror is properly adjusted	
when a portion of the is	
driver's door handle is visible in the lower right corner	
there's the handle	
oh, no, too far	
bringing it back	
optimized	
now, where is the switch to adjust	
the passenger side mirror	
it's right there	
where is the passenger	
side mirror	
in a parking lot in hollywood	
now, can we please go	
yes as soon as i adjust my seat	
whee	
oh, dear	
i'm going to have	
start again	
if i could speak the language of rabbits,	
they would be amazed,	
and i would be their king	
i hate my name	
it has "nerd" in it	
lennerd	
i lost my virginity to my cousin jeanie	
i would be kind to my rabbit subjects	
at first	
you know what's a cool name	
angelo	
that has angel and jello in it	
it was my uncle murray's	
funeral	
we were all back at my aunt barbara's house	
our eyes locked	
over the pickled herring	
we never meant for it to happen	
one day, i hold a great ball	
for the president of france,	
but the rabbits	
they hate me and don't come	
i am embarrassed, so i eat	
all the lettuce in the world	
and make them watch	
people could call me angie	
yo, angie, how's it goin'	
to this day, i can't look at pickled herring without being aroused that is a shame	
oh cousin jeanie	
could you please drive a little faster	
oh, i think we're going sufficiently fast	
what's that	
nothing the engine does that	
sometimes	
it can't be nothing	
the check engine light is on	
we need	to find a service station	
no the light has been on	
since i bought the car	
all the more reason to consult with a mechanic	
before it explodes	
it's not going to explode	
just keep driving	
warp speed ahead, mr spock	
mr spock did not pilot the enterprise	
he was the science officer,	
and i guarantee you that	
if he ever saw the enterprise's	
check engine light blinking,	
he would pull the ship over	
immediately	
oh, god, i'm gonna lose the arm	
oh, oh, red light	
release accelerator	
and slowly apply the brake	
nailed it	
while we have a moment,	
may i ask you a question	
what	
why do you have the chinese character for soup	
tattooed on your	
right buttock	
it's not soup	
it's courage	
no, it isn't	
but i suppose	
it does take courage	
to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup	
how did you see it	
you said you wouldn't look	
sorry	
as i told you, the hero always peeks anything	
no that was the last	
pudding cup	
no	
what about slim jim's	
that's what he used to eat his pudding, remember	
right that was so good	
sweety and meaty	
at the same time	
wait wait, wait	
so you're saying	
we're out of food	
the only thing in here are blue ice packs	
i know they're poison,	
but they look like big,	
yummy otter pops	
oh, god, i am so hungry	
me, too	
check and see	
if we have any more pudding	
all right, there's no need to bark at me	
according to the inexplicably	
irritable nurse behind the desk,	
you'll be seen after the man	
who claims to be having a heart attack,	
but appears to be well enough to play doodle jump on his iphone	
we have to fill these out	
"describe illness or injury"	
i dislocated	
my shoulder	
all right	
and how did the accident occur	
you ready know that	
"cause of accident"	
"lack of adhesive ducks"	
okay, medical history	
"have you ever been diagnosed	
with diabetes"	
no	
kidney disease	
no	
migraines	
getting one	
"are you currently	
pregnant"	
no	
are you sure	
you look a bit puffy	
change migraine to yes	
"when was your last menstrual period"	
oh next question	
i'll put, "in progress"	
okay, moving to psychiatric disorders	
"list all major	
behavioural diagnoses,	
"eg depression,	
anxiety, etcetera"	
oh, my god, what the	
hell does this have to do with my stupid shoulder	
"episodes of sub psychotic	
rage"	
ass	
"possible tourette's"	
all right "moles, lesions	
or other skin conditions"	
"soup tattoo on right buttock"	
hey, sheldon,	
sheldon, look,	
i am scared and	in a lot of pain	
could you please just take a break from being you and try being	
i don't know	
comforting	
i'm sorry	
there, there	
every thing's going to be fine	
sheldon's here	
thanks	
that's much better	
oh, i'm so hungry	
will you shut up	
we're all hungry	
okay, our objective is the boy scout	
campsite to the east	
easy target	
big doughy scout master,	
couple of cubs, most webelos	
what kind of score	
we looking at	
hot dogs, buns, s'mores	
i mean, it's a freaking	
all right,	
everyone grab flash lights	
oh, my god, could it be	
yes	
my mother put an "i love you" brisket in my backpack	
quick, get forks	
you don't need forks	
it's so tender,	
it falls apart in your hands	
he's right	
i feel like we're forgetting something important	
me, too	
but what	
maybe a tupperware bowl	of roasted potatoes and carrots	
yes	
yes	
now remember, you were given powerful pain medication	
and a muscle relaxer,	
so, uh, don't operate heavy machinery	
try not to choke on your own drool	
wait you have	
to help me get into bed	
sheldon has to get me into bed	
bet you never thought	
i'd say that	
yes	
the charm of your drug addled	
candour knows no bounds	
you know, people think	
you're this weird robot man	
who's so annoying all the time,	
and you totally are	
but then it's like that movie walle at the end	
you're so full of love,	
and you can save a plant	
and get fat people	
out of the floaty chairs	
that's a fairly laboured metaphor,	
but i appreciate the sentiment behind it	
sing "soft kitty" to me	
"soft kitty" is for	
when you're sick	
you're not sick	
injured and drugged	
is a kind of sick	
soft kitty, warm kitty,	
little ball of fur	
wait, wait	
let's sing it as a round	
i'll start	
soft kitty, warm kitty,	
little ball of fur	
i'll start over	
soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur	
soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur	
soft kitty, warm kitty,	
little ball of fur	
happy kitty,	
sleepy kitty	
happy kitty,	
sleepy kitty	
happy kitty,	
purr, purr, purr	
purr, purr, purr	
and the next morning	
when he woke up,	
he rolled over and realized	
duhduhduh	
she was his cousin	
that's still not funny	
that's still not funny	
and she was my second cousin	
and she was my	
second cousin	
you're a real douche	
who cares	
you slept with your cousin
