all right, that's the last servo	
behold	
the mobile omnidirectional neutralization	
and termination eradicator	
or	
monte	
featuring one articulated	
razorsharp killing saw,	
one polycarbonate grinding	
and flipping wheel,	
steelarmor plate exoskeleton	
top and bottom,	
and enough horsepower to drive	
a  pounds of mechanized death	
from zero to holy crap	
in  seconds	
is it wrong to say	
i love our killer robot	
as with my father,	
i both love and fear it	
all right, enough chitchat	
let's destroy something	
one, two, three	
what shall be first to taste	
the wrath of monte	
maybe we should start small	
perhaps today is the day	
we finally find out	
what's inside the magic eight ball	
did it when i was four	
it's an icosahedral die	
floating in tinted blue water	
man, call "spoiler alert" before you say things like that	
how about the toaster oven	
what did the toaster oven	
ever do to you	
what did i ever do to jimmy mullins	
in the third grade	
he still punched me in the face	
with my own fists	
sorry, little nerd,	
you were just in the wrong boys' room	
at the wrong time	
gentlemen, goggles	
this is an auspicious moment	
like robert oppenheimer	
or neil armstrong,	
we need the appropriate words	
to mark this historic scientific event	
how about "die, toaster, die"	
that'll do it	
all right, what's next	
no, i think i'm just going	
to stay in tonight and do laundry	
this door got the full monte	
what the hell	
killer robot	
we built it	
yeah, well, it almost killed me	
if it wanted to kill you,	
you'd be dead	
so, who exactly	
does it want to kill	
i'm sorry, are you	
unaware of the upcoming	
southern california	
robot fighting league	
round robin invitational	
you know, since i moved last year,	
not all my mail has been forwarded	
it's a big deal	
there's an awards banquet	
and a dance afterward	
perhaps you'd like to come with me	
i know the other fellas would be	
really excited to see a girl there	
how is it supposed to be a dance	
if i'm the only girl	
well, that may be	
a slight exaggeration	
you'd be the only doable girl	
you are a pig, howard	
how is "doable" anything	
but a compliment	
why don't we just work on the robot	
please, not now	
once again, penny and i	
have begun our little tango	
our tango	
the carnal repartee,	
the erotic to and fro	
but as delicious	
as the appetizer might be,	
at some point	
we will have to succumb	
and eat the entr√©e	
while it's still	
hot	
i'm begging you, stop talking	
look, normally	
i can just ignore you	
i get it you're a little peculiar	
like sheldon	
excuse me, penny, but in this room,	
you're the one who's peculiar	
you might be right	
but back to you	
i know you think you're some sort	
of smoothtalking ladies' man,	
but the truth is,	
you are just pathetic and creepy	
so what are you saying	
i am saying it is not a compliment	
to call me "doable"	
it's not sexy to stare	
at my ass and say,	
"it must be jelly 'cause	
jam don't shake like that"	
and most important,	
we are not dancing a tango,	
we're not to'ing and fro'ing	
nothing is ever going	
to happen between us ever	
wait a minute	
this isn't flirting	
you're serious	
flirting	
you think i'm flirting with you	
i am not flirting with you	
no woman is ever gonna flirt with you	
you're just gonna grow old and die alone	
thanks for the heads up	
where you going	
i'm going home to live	
my creepy, pathetic life	
someone had to say it	
what	
he said maybe we should enter you	
in the killer robot competition	
howard, the phone is ringing	
here's a crazy idea, ma answer it	
all right, hold on	
it's your friend, leonard	
he wants to know why	
you're not at school today	
i don't go to school, ma	
i work at a university	
that's a school	
now pick up the phone	
i don't want to talk to anybody	
should i ask leonard to bring	
over your homework	
i don't have homework	
i'm a grown man with a master's	
degree in engineering	
excuse me, mr fancypants	
want me to get you a popsicle	
cherry, please	
i ate the cherry	
all that's left is green	
you make me want to kill myself	
what's going on	
i don't know,	
now they're just yelling	
about popsicles	
sounds like penny really got to him	
i'm not surprised	
despite his hard and crusty shell,	
howard is a very sensitive man	
do you know he writes poetry	
mostly about men from nantucket	
and hermits named dave,	
but he does it	
with real sensitivity	
hey, hofstadter	
word around the pwasma wab	
is you built a wobot	
yes, we did, kripke	
his name is monte	
well, if you have any dewusions	
about entering him	
against my wobot,	
the kwipke kwippler	
in the southern california	
robot fighting league	
wound wobin invitational,	
aka the scrflrri,	
his name is gonna be scwap metal	
come on, is that really necessary	
leonard, i believe it is	
this is trash talk,	
and trash talk is a traditional	
component in all sporting events	
kripke,	
your robot is inferior	
and it will be defeated by ours	
because ours exceeds yours	
in both design and execution	
also, i'm given to understand	
that your mother is overweight	
oh, snap	
of course, if that is the result of a glandular condition	
and not sloth and gluttony,	
i withdraw that comment	
what difference does it make	
fat is fat	
there are boundaries	
tell you what,	
forget the scrflrri	
wet's settle this woboto a woboto	
what do you mean	
there's no guarantee	
we're gonna go against each other	
in the wound wobin,	
so let's throw down	
you know,	
unless you're afwaid	
we accept your challenge	
name a time and place	
tomorrow, , the kinetics wab	
make it so	
no, don't make it so	
barry, we can't fight you tomorrow	
our engineer is incapacitated	
what's wrong with him	
he's depressed because he's pathetic and creepy and can't get girls	
we're all pathetic and cweepy and can't get girls	
that's why we fight wobots	
if you're not there,	
you'll be exposed to widicule	
i'm curious, what part of america is that accent from	
you got a minute	
yeah, come on in	
what's up	
i need you to apologize to howward	
get out	
come on he won't come out of his house	
and we need him for a robot battle	
well, then have the robot go and get him	
the robot didn't hurt his feelings	
his feelings needed to be hurt	
he's been in bed for two days	
probably with a blowup doll	
he's not with a	
does it really matter who or what he's with	
the guy is devastated	
please, how could i possibly devastate howard	
okay, don't take this as a criticism,	
but you kind of have that overexposedtogammarays	
thing going on	
what does that mean	
you know, like, most of the time,	
you're the easygoing bruce banner,	
but then, when you get angry,	
you kind of turn into, like, you know	
i turn into a bear	
seriously gamma rays bruce banner	
you didn't get the incredible hulk	
never mind	
just, please go talk to him	
and say what	
that i didn't mean it,	
because i meant it	
maybe you can go at it	
from a different angle,	
like, you see a	
glimmer of goodness in him	
and you only said what you said	
because you want to	
nurture it and make it shine	
okay, let's try it this way	
remember the day	
we met and you asked me to go to your boyfriend's apartment to get your tv back	
and he was nine feet tall and he took my pants off and you said	
what was that	
what did you say	
oh, yes	
you said you owed me one	
okay, come on, that's not fair	
i came home with no pants	
fine, i'll go over there tomorrow	
thank you	
i should probably give you	
a heads up about his mother	
what about her	
she's a delightful woman	
you'll love her	
howard, there's a blonde girl,	
patsy, here to see you	
who	
okay, now she's saying it's penny	
i don't wanna talk to her	
ma	
she ran past me	
was i supposed to tackle her	
so, i just came by	
to see how you were doing	
i'm fine	
good	
your mom seems nice	
people move away from her on the bus	
what do you want	
i just want to apologize	
for some things that i have said about you	
i've been informed that you have feelings	
and apparently, i have hurt them	
so, i'm sorry	
fine you're sorry	
goodbye	
so you're okay	
hey, i'm a big boy	
i'm not traumatized by some random comment from some random woman	
i mean, get over yourself	
bye	
so close	
oh, my god	
that's kripke's robot	
as you can see, the kwippler is weducing the chevy cavawier to wubble	
i can't watch anymore	
sheldon, we have to call it off	
we don't have that option	
we've accepted the challenge	
we can't run away from a fight	
please, we've spent our whole lives running away from fights	
personally, i can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size	
impressive as that may be,	
monte is not us	
monte has no fear	
didn't we watch the same video	
kripke's robot just had angry sex with a midsized automobile	
you are overlooking the fact	
we know what we're up against	
and we can modify monte	
so that he's prepared	
you wanna prepare him	
install a bladder and a pair of shorts	
so he can wet himself	
excuse me, but how are we gonna make any modifications without wolowitz	
have you heard from penny	
not yet	
have faith, gentlemen	
we don't need wolowitz	
engineering is merely	
the slow younger brother of physics	
watch and learn	
do either of you know	
how to open the toolbox	
and then, when i was ,	
i met marcy grossman	
she was so beautiful	
she just got her braces off	
but they left a little of the overbite	
it was so hot like a sexy little chipmunk	
i didn't have the courage to ask her out,	
but i dedicated a song to her at the ninth grade talent show	
that sounds sweet	
marcy grossman is sunshine	
on a cloudy day	
when it's cold outside	
marcy grossman is the month of may	
it's cute	
i guess	
you'd say	
what can make me feel this way	
marcy grossman,	
marcy grossman, marcy grossman	
talkin' 'bout marcy	
that's great	
grossman	
it's fun	
and then she came up	
with that sexy little chipmunk mouth	
and spit in my hair	
which brings us to tenth grade	
do you think maybe sometimes	
you try too hard	
look at me	
what chance do i have	
if i don't try too hard	
you'd have a terrific chance	
i mean, you're smart, you're funny	
you have a cool job	
you build stuff that goes into outer space	
i guess	
i'm telling you,	
i've known you for a year and a half and this is the first time i feel like i'm talking to a real person	
and you know what i like him	
he's a nice guy	
you really think so	
i don't know	
i do	
nice little bot you've got here	
i'm aware	
what's this do, spin	
yep at  rpm	
it can cut through steel	
like it was wubber	
neat	
good work	
sheldon, we've gotta call this off	
no, leonard	
for years,	
merciless thugs like kripke have made my life	
a series of painful noogies	
and humiliating wedgies	
and the insensitively named	
indian burns	
that stops now	
but we don't have a chance	
the only improvement you were able to make was to put fresh batteries in the remote	
what you fail to realize is	kripke suffers from a fatal flaw	
overconfidence	
from his robot's massive size and its overwhelming power	
that's not overconfidence	
that's observation	
trust me, kripke will fall easy prey to my psychological warfare	
observe	
i would ask if your robot is prepared to meet its maker,	
but as you are its maker,	
clearly the two of you have met	
what is his pwoblem	
way to bust out	
the jedi mind tricks, dude	
i just wanna make sure	
we're all clear	
standard robotic fighting	
league rules apply	
are you cwazy	
this is a stweet fight	
the stweet has no rules	
he's right, leonard	
the paradigm is to the death	
i will, however,	
give you the opportunity to concede my superiority now and offer me your robot	
as the spoils of war	
never	
i'd rather see monte dead	
than in your hands	
that could be easily arranged	
ready, set, go	
do it	
all right then	
weady set go	
come on, sheldon, you got this	
indeed	
we are prepared for anything	
he can throw at us	
that's new	
run, monte, run	
run, monte	
go, go, go, go	
don't hurt us, don't hurt us,	
don't hurt us	
well, so much for making up for the emotional wounds of childhood	
i did this	
monte was killed by my hubris and my pride	
no matter what anybody says,	
this is my fault	
no one's arguing with you, dude	
i got your text how bad is	
forget the robot	
what happened to you	
he slipped and fell	
yes,	
i slipped and fell in the bathroom bounced right off the tub	
now he knows what bathtubs are capable of doing	
when you don't treat them with respect	
they sucker punch you	
when your eyes are closed	
so what do you think, howard	
it's not that bad, right	
a little electrical tape,	
some solder	
are you insane	
i've seen space probes	
that crashed into the desert	
that were in better shape than this	
you're right	
monte's gone	
we'll bury him in the morning	
a simple ceremony i'll speak	
leonard, you'll play your cello	
honey, aren't you getting a little carried away	
i mean, it's just a toy robot	
"just a toy robot"	
i know, i got it	
sheldon, i'm sorry	
don't get the wrong idea	
the way i see it,	
i'm halfway to pity sex
