your argument is lacking on all scientific merit	
and it is well established,	
superman cleans his uniform by flying into earth yellow sun,	
which incinerate any contaminate matter	
and leaves the unvulnerable kryptonian	
fabric unharmed and daisy fresh	
what if he gets something kryptonian on it	
like what	
i don't know kryptonian mustard	
i think we can safely assume	
that all kryptonian condiments were destroyed	
when the planet krypton exploded	
or it turned nto mustard kryptonite,	
the only way to destroy a rogue	
kryptonian hotdog threatening earth	
raj, please,	
let's stay serious here	
superman's body is kryptonian,	
therefore his sweat is kryptonian	
what about kryptonian pit stains	
superman doesn't sweat on earth	
he's invited for dinner	in the bottle city of kandor	
he miniaturizes himself, enters the city	
where he loses his superpowers	
before dinner, his host says,	
"who's up for a little kryptonian tetherball"	
superman says "sure," works up a sweat, comes back to earth,	
his uniform now stained with indestructible kryptonian perspiration	
boo ya	
superman would have taken his uniform to a kandorian dry cleaner	
before he left the bottle	
"kandorian dry cl" i give up	
you can't have a rational argument with this man	
isn't that the guy who won	
the macarthur genius grant last year	
no, not all at once	
then how	
leonard	
now, raj	
now, sheldon	
i didn't get a good look	
can i go again	
it's david underhill so what	
so what	
his observation of highenergy positrons has provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of galactic dark matter	
i have two words for you	
the first is "big," the other's "whoop"	
it is a big whoop	
it made almost all the work	
you've done completely useless	
did not	
did, too	
okay, maybe some of it, but	
the guy was just in the right place,	
at the right time with the right paradigmshifting	
reinterpretation of the universe	
he got lucky in more ways than one	
he's a very handsome man	
doesn't do anything for me	
if i was gonna go that way,	
i'm more of a zac efron kinda guy	
yeah, like you have	
a shot with zac efron	
excuse me	
are you leonard hofstadter	
i'm david underhill	
dr gablehauser said if i wanted to set something up in the photomultiplier lab,	
that you'd be able to give me a hand	
you want to work with me	
if you have a little time	
sure	
yeah, no problem	
here's my home number	
here's my cell	
here's my office	
here's my parents' number up in new jersey	
they always know how to reach me	
congratulations on the macarthur grant,	
by the way big fan	
thanks i'll call you	
byebye	
what are you looking at	
you've never seen a hypocrite before	
trailing badly,	
wolowitz needs a strike	
if he has any hopes of catching up with sheldon cooper,	
who is dominating in the ninth frame with a careerbest	
hey, guys	
that doesn't count	
do over do over	
there are no doovers	
in wii bowling	
there are always doovers	
when my people play sports	
where were you that's more important than wii bowling night	
actually	
it's rhetorical	
there is nothing more important than wii bowling night	
come on, it's just a video game	
and we suck at it	
nice motivational speech	
from the team captain	
where were you	
i was working with dave underhill	
"dave" sounds like	
leonard's got a new bff	
actually, he's pretty cool	
not only is he a brilliant scientist,	
but it turns out	
he's a black diamond skier	
he collects vintage motorcycles	
he plays in a rock band	
so we're in a rock band	
no	
we play rock band on our xbox	
nice motivational speech	
from our lead guitarist	
he's funny, too	
he does this hysterical impersonation of stephen hawking having phone sex	
what are you wearing	
that's not he does it better	
he said he was gonna	
take me to the gym tomorrow,	
so i'm gonna go practice my situps	
humongous man crush,	
dude	
yeah	
it's officially a bromance	
are you and leonard putting up a christmas tree	
no, because we don't celebrate the ancient pagan festival of saturnalia	
saturnalia	
gather round, kids,	
it's time for sheldon's	
beloved christmas special	
in the prechristian era,	
as the winter solstice approached and the plants died,	
pagans brought evergreen boughs	into their homes	
as an act of sympathetic magic,	
intended to guard the life essences of the plants until spring	
this custom was later appropriated	
by northern europeans	
and eventually it becomes the socalled christmas tree	
and that, charlie brown, is what boredom is all about	
thank you for that,	
but i got you and leonard	
a few silly neighbor gifts,	
so i'll just put them under my tree	
wait	
you bought me a present	
why would you do such a thing	
'cause it's christmas	
i know you think	
you're being generous,	
but the foundation of giftgiving is reciprocity	
you haven't given me a gift	
you've given me an obligation	
don't feel bad, penny,	
it's a classic rookie mistake	
my first hanukah with sheldon,	
he yelled at me for eight nights	
you don't have to get me anything in return	
of course i do	
the essence of the custom	
is that i now have to go out and	
purchase a gift of commensurate value	
and representing the same	
perceived level of friendship	
as that represented	
by the gift you've given me	
it's no wonder suicide rates	
skyrocket this time of year	
forget it	
i'm not giving you a present	
it's too late i see it	
that elf sticker says, "to sheldon"	
the die has been cast	
the moving finger has writ,	
hannibal has crossed the alps	
i know it's funny	
when it's not happening to us	
sheldon, i am very, very sorry	
no, i brought this on myself	
by being such an endearing	
and important part of your life	
i'm going to need a ride to the mall	
it's happening to us	
are you gonna make it	
yeah, i guess	
thanks for letting me try out	
your motorcycle	
no problem	
i had no idea it was so heavy	
the thing just fell right	
over on me, didn't it	
yeah	
lucky for you it wasn't moving	
hey, leonard are you okay	
it's just a little	
motorcycle accident	
my god, how fast were you going	
i don't know it's all such a blur	
good one	
he couldn't even get it started	
hi dave	
hi	
penny	
so it's your motorcycle	
is it okay	
it's fine	
lucky for the bike	
it landed on my leg	
you mind giving me a hand with speed racer here	
how do you know leonard	
i'm a physicist	
no, you're not	
why is that so surprising	
well, it's just that	
the physicists i know are indoorsy and pale	
i'm not indoorsy	
i just wear the appropriate sun block	
because i don't take	
melanoma lightly	
so, are you and leonard	
working on an experiment together	
actually we are	
we're examining the radiation levels of photomultiplier tubes	
for a new dark matter detector	
sweetie, sweetie, dave was talking	
you know, i love science	
since when	
since always	
call me a geek, but i am just nuts	
for the whole subatomic	
particle thing	
the last thing i would	
ever call you is a geek	
well, that's what i am	
queen of the nerds	
if you like, i could show you	
the lab we're working in	
we've got some cool toys,	
you know, lasers and stuff	
you know, i have always wanted to see a big science lab	
since when	
since always	
leonard, are you okay here	
i guess	
how about we go see it now	
maybe afterwards we take the bike, we grab a little bite to eat	
yeah, that sounds great	
let me just get my jacket	
boy, she'll do, huh	
yeah, if you like that type	
so, you and her	
no, just neighbors	
really	
i don't know how you live next door to that	
without doing something about it	
actually	
science is my lady	
okay let's go	
all right	
see you tomorrow, leonard	
see ya	
have fun	
did you forget your key	
i don't see anything in here	
a woman would want	
you're kidding	
you've got lotions	
and bath oils and soaps	
that's the estrogen hat trick	
what it is is a cacophonous assault of eucalyptus, bayberry,	
cinnamon and vanilla	
it's as if my head were trapped	
in the pajamas of a sultan	
if you don't like this stuff,	
let's go next door and build her a bear	
i told you before,	
bears are terrifying	
come on,	
bath stuff it's perfect	
you got a scented candle,	
a cleansing buff,	
spearmint and green tea scented	
bath oil, promotes relaxation	
that presupposes penny is tense	
she knows you she's tense	
we all are	

excuse me, we're ready	
no, we're not	
let's say for a moment that i accept the bath item gift hypothesis,	
i now lay the following	
conundrum at your feet	
which size	
this one let's go	
you put no thought into that	
i'm sorry	
this one	

i have insufficient data to proceed	
excuse me, miss	
if i were to give you	
this gift basket,	
based on that action alone	
and no other data,	
infer and describe the hypothetical relationship that exists between us	
excuse me	
here	
now, are we friends	
colleagues lovers	
are you my grandmother	
i don't understand	
what you're talking about	
and you're making me	
a little uncomfortable	
see sounds just like you and penny	
we'll take it	
leonard come, join us	
hey, dave	
and penny, what a surprise	
dave was just showing me	
around the university	
this place is unbelievable	
i know, i've been offering to show	
you around for a year and a half	
you always said you had yoga	
i never said that	
maybe i heard you wrong	
a lot of words sound like "yoga"	
this is an amazing woman	
she has a curious and agile mind,	
not to mention being curious and agile	
in other respects	
shut up	
yes, please shut up	
so dave,	
don't you think you and i should get back to the lab	
you know, that dark matter	
isn't going to detect itself	
actually, i was thinking about	
taking the afternoon off	
so i could work on another	
experiment with penny	
really we're going to do an experiment	
we're going to explore	
the effects of tequila shots	
on a gorgeous yearold woman	
it's not an experiment	
you saw what happened last night	
you ready to go	
yeah	
can i drive the motorcycle	
yeah, why not	
you can't do any worse than leonard	
that's funny	
by the way, my leg is killing me	
thanks for asking	
great news, leonard	
i've solved my penny gift dilemma	
yippee	
you see, the danger was	
that i might under or overreciprocate,	
but i have devised a foolproof plan	
see, i will open	
her gift to me first	
and then excuse myself,	
feigning digestive distress	
then	
i'll look up the price of her gift online, choose the basket closest to that value,	give it to her	
and then i'll return the others	
for a full refund	
brilliant	
it is, isn't it	
is it okay if i hide them	
in your room	
the smell makes me nauseated	
do whatever you want	
thank you, that's very gracious	
gentlemen	
why couldn't you have just done what leonard did and get penny a new boyfriend	
my leg is killing me	
thanks for asking	
i have just one question for you	
while i am perfectly happy with the way	
things are between us,	
you said you didn't want to go out with me	
because i was too smart for you	
news flash, lady	
david underhill is ten times smarter than me	
you'd have to drive a railroad spike into his brain	
for me to beat him at checkers	
next to him, i'm like one of those signlanguage gorillas	
who knows how to ask for grapes	
so, my question is	
what's up with that	
why are you yelling at me	
sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry	
never mind, we're cool	
dave is not smarter than you	
he's an idiot	
really why would you say that	
because a smart guy takes	
the nude photos of his wife	
off his cell phone	
before he tries to take nude photos of his girlfriend	
he tried to take nude photos of you	
that's what you took from that	
the guy is married	
i'm so oh, that's terrible	
and you, if you are so okay with the way things are between us,	
why are you so jealous	
the important thing is	
he's married and that's terrible	
nice save, genius	
eggnog	
lactose	
it's just rum it stopped being eggnog	
like half an hour ago	
smooth	
smoother than you	
come on, it's christmas,	
just give me this one	
merry christmas	
by the way, my leg is killing me	
thanks for asking	
merry christmas	
how's your leg	
very good, thanks for asking	
come on in	
good, penny,	
you're here to exchange gifts	
you'll be pleased to know i'm prepared	
for whatever you have to offer	
okay, here	
i should note i'm having	
some digestive distress,	
so, if i excuse myself abruptly,	
don't be alarmed	
a napkin	
turn it over	
"to sheldon,	
live long and prosper	
"leonard nimoy"	
he came into the restaurant	
sorry the napkin's dirty	
he wiped his mouth with it	
i possess the dna of leonard nimoy	
yeah, i guess	
but look, he signed it	
do you realize what this means	
all i need is a healthy ovum	
and i can grow my own leonard nimoy	
all i'm giving you is the napkin, sheldon	
be right back	
here open it	
a gift cerficate	
for motorcycle lessons	
very thoughtful	
yeah, and i checked	
not letting the bike fall on you	
while standing still is lesson one	
then, i think you'll appreciate	
what i got you	
" totally cool science	
experiments for kids"	
you know,	
'cause you're so into science	
sheldon what did you do	
i know	
it's not enough, is it	
here	
leonard, look	
sheldon's hugging me	
it's a saturnalia miracle
