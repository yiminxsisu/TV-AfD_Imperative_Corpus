okay, it's done look, guys,	
for the future, i don't mind killing the big spiders,	
but you have to at least try with the little ones	
please we're facing a far more serious problem than stray arachnids	
it's not so bad	
not bad it's horrible	
you hear stories about this things,	
but you never think it'll happen to you	
so they steamed your dumplings	
get over it	
new topic, please	
all right, penny	
let me take this opportunity to point out that you are looking particularly ravishing today	
not with a thousand condoms, howard	
so, there is a number	
okay, new topic, please	
did you hear the people upstairs in a are moving out	
what	
the people upstairs are moving out	
no	
the horror	
why would you just say something like that	
how else was i supposed to say it	
slowly	
like putting a new fish in a tank	
you don't just drop it in	
you let the bag sit in the water a while	
the horror	
i'm sure it's going to be fine	
no, it's not going to be fine	
change is never fine	
they say it is, but it's not	
honey, did you even know the people that are moving out	
i never met them	
that's what made them perfect	
there were no awkward "hellos" in the halls	
there's no clicketyclacking of high heel shoes on hardwood floors	
they may as well have been a family of cats just jumping around from drape to drape without that annoying	
ammonia urine smell	
i'm sure the new people will be just as quiet	
you can't know that	
how can you possibly know that	
you're right, i can't you know what anyone could rent that apartment now	
an opera singer, the cast of stomp	
yeah, a tapdancing pirate with a wooden leg	
why are you making it worse	
i tried making it better	
he wouldn't go for it	
you're right	
that's a great idea	
what	
i'll take the apartment upstairs	
i can finally get away from my mother and we can all spend some more time together	
if you catch my drift	
the horror	
hold on you honestly expect me to believe that social protocol dictates we break our backs	
helping wolowitz move,	
and then he only need buy us a pizza	
i'm sorry, that really is how it works	
you're tricking me	
you tell me the truth,	
what do we get	
help me out here	
you get to choose between a mountain bike or a ps	
i knew it	
ps, definitely ps	
who would pick a mountain bike	
enough with the guilt, ma	
we'll still see each other	
i'll come over every night and have dinner with you	
the hell you will	
what am i running here, a fancy restaurant	
does this look like olive garden	
okay, i get it, you're angry	
you don't want to see your little bird leave the nest	
"little bird"	
you're almost fly, for god's sake	
fine, i'll stay	
ya happy, crazy lady	
i sure as hell hope so,	
because you're ruining my life	
hey, penny good news,	
you can take your head out of the oven	
i guess i won't be needing this	
the new ones	
they're here	
stay calm we don't know	
anything about them yet	
what are you doing	
i'm checking for musical instruments	
does that sound like castanets to you	
the box says "kitchen"	
so do cocaine smugglers write "cocaine" on the box	
hello	
hello	
hello	
i'm alicia	
i'm moving in upstairs	
that is so great	
oh, i'm leonard	
i live downstairs	
upstairs from here, but under you	
not under you per se, but under your apartment	
that's nice	
yeah, it is	
if that concludes your faltering attempt to mate	
on a scale of one to ten, how light of foot would you describe yourself, with one being not catlike at all, and ten being freakishly feline	
"freakishly feline"	
is that your answer or do you not understand the question	
we'll come back to that one	
hang on are you now	
or have you ever been a salsa, irish folk or breakdancer	
you're making her uncomfortable	
oh, i'm sorry	
if it helps you feel any better,	
you're doing very well so far	
next question are you fertile	
what	
i'm trying to determine whether crying infants above my head are a possibility	
i have no immediate plans	
if that changes, let me know	
and finally, area rugs, pro or con	
pro	
alicia	
yes	
welcome to the building	
thanks so much for helping me	
thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help	
hey, guys	
this is alicia, our new neighbor	
hi	
hi	
i'm helping	
i can see	
alicia's nonmusical, childless and prorug	
she's still on probation, of course,	
but i like her	
cool tshirt	
oh, i don't usually dress like this	
i'm going jogging	
you don't jog	
i can start	
true, but the more likely explanation is	
that you're out of clean clothes again	
thank you, sheldon	
you're welcome, penny	
please, you look cute	
i'm dressed like a slob today, too	
i think you look fantastic	
this one's a player, huh	
yeah, be careful	
thanks for the warning	
i'll see you around	
see ya	
i'm dressed like a slob today, too	
oh, mimicry	
i enjoy mimicry	
i've been working on admiral ackbar from return of the jedi	
"it's a trap"	
you have to imagine me with a giant squid head	
"it's a trap"	
come	
congratulations,	
i see you did your laundry	
sort of	
how does one "sort of"	
i bought new clothes, okay	
is leonard around	
he's upstairs at alicia's	
oh all right,	
that's cool, no biggie	
he said he'd help me set up my printer,	
but i guess i can wait	
what exactly is he doing up there	
in what i can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me,	
he is with wolowitz and koothrappali	
setting up her stereo	
oh, they're all up there	
typical	
it's axiomatically atypical	
up until recently,	
they did not know her, and had no encounters with her in a previous location	
they never went upstairs to visit the former tenants	
your characterization of their behavior as "typical" is demonstrably fallacious	
now i see the giant squid head	
oh, great	
now, i have to start all over again	
yeah, i thought about renting this apartment,	
but i'm really more of a "downtown loft" kind of guy	
cool so are you in a loft now	
oh, actually, i'm, living with a woman in altadena	
purely platonic	
she's also my maid	
sounds like a sweet deal	
i won't lie it's pretty dope	
i just wanted to bring you a little housewarming gift	
that is so sweet	
come on in let's open it	
great	
nice dress	
this i'm dressed like a slob today	
the guys have been helping me set up my sound system	
i've never had such goodlooking technical support	
pishposh	
i don't know, it means shucks	
"shucks" means shucks	
let one go once in a while	
you want to hear something awesome	
alicia is an actress, just like you	
that is so awesome	
well, trying to be,	
but it's so hard	
i know, tell me about it	
i've been out here  months,	
and all i've gotten is a couple of national commercials	
and this recurring thing on a soap	
that's why i work at the cheesecake factory	
i'm holding out for the right part	
what do you want as your default setting for dvds,  dolby or dts	
whatever you think is best, cutie	
well, dts has more low end, so	
hey, guys, guys,	
you will really appreciate this	
i read the best science joke	
you won't get it,	
but it's right up their alley	
anyway,	
this physicist goes into an ice cream parlor every week and orders an ice cream sundae for himself,	
and then offers one to the empty stool sitting next to him	
this goes on for a while until the owner finally asks him what he's doing	
the man says, "well, i'm a physicist, "and quantum mechanics teaches us "that it is possible for the matter above this stool "to spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman "who might accept my offer and fall in love with me"	
the owner then says, "lots of single, beautiful women come in here ever day "buy an ice cream for one of them, and they might fall in love with you" and the physicist says, "yeah, but what are the odds of that happening"	
it's a little insulting,	
don't you think	
how would i know	
i'm not even sure i get it	
leonard	
if you're done with the dvd player,	
can you set up my printer	
yeah, i'd love to	
maybe when you're done with her printer,	
you could set up mine	
you know, like you promised a week ago	
yeah, i'll get to it	
don't nag me	
hello there	
who is it	
hello, penny	
it's open come in	
sarcasm	
well, they're all still up there	
you think i can't hear them	
listen to that stomp, stomp, stomp	
that's wolowitz in his stacked heels that fool no one	
i don't even know why i care	
i don't care	
enough to memorize that stupid joke,	
but that's all i care	
you know, penny,	
there's something that occurs in beehives	
you might find interesting	
occasionally, a new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power	
when this happens, the old queen must either locate to a new hive or engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains	
what are you saying,	
that i'm threatened by alicia	
i'm like the old queen of the hive	
and it's just time for me to go	
i'm just talking about bees	
they're on the discovery channel	
what are you talking about	
bees	
i just got that physicist joke	
gee, penny,	
thanks for buying us dinner	
yeah, what's the occasion	
no occasion	
just felt like getting some chinese chow for my peeps	
did you remember to ask for the chicken to be diced, not shredded	
even though the menu description specifies shredded	
brown rice, not white	
did you stop at the grocery for the good hot mustard and pick up the lowsodium soy sauce from the market	
good	
see how it's done	
what do we got going on tonight	
playing halo, watching battlestar, drop some mentos in diet coke	
you want to watch battlestar	
what can i say	
i got my geek on, boys	
no, pms is different	
thank god you're home i need help	
what's wrong	
i got a callback to audition for csi to play a hooker who gets killed	
i'd watch that	
but my car is in the shop,	
and i have to be at universal in  minutes	
i'll take you	
you're a lifesaver	
i'll run lines with you in the car	
great	
and afterward, i'll take you all out for chinese	
actually, we already have	
starving	
chinese food right here	
they're gone, penny	
they can't hear you	
i cannot believe they're letting her just use them like that	
anything she wants, they go panting after her like trained dogs	
you know last week,	
she had howard drive all the way o her uncle's house in orange county to pick up her tv	
you once had leonard and me get your television from your exboyfriend	
apples and oranges here, sheldon	
i'm telling you, that girl is a user,	
skating through life on her looks, taking advantage of weakwilled men, getting auditions for stupid network shows	
it just creams my corn	
may i interject something here	
please	
you got the wrong mustard	
guess what	
i got the part on csi	
oh, boy	
something wrong	
no, you know, congratulations	
i think you'll make a great hooker	
thank you	
i got to ask you something	
how much do physicists make	
i don't know i don't think a lot	
yeah, that's what i figured	
well, got to run	
the guys promised to set up my satellite dish and paint my bedroom	
can i talk to you about that for a second	
about what	
you know, it's just that leonard and howard and raj,	
they aren't like other guys	
they're special	
okay, they're special and	
let's see how can i explain this	
they don't know how to use their shields	
shields	
yeah, like in star trek, when you're in battle and you raise the shields where the hell'd that come from	
anyways, you know	
how guys like this are, so	
please don't take advantage of them	
who says i'm taking advantage of them	
come on	
they're doing everything for you,	
because you're leading them on	
so i let them do stuff for me	
they're happy i get stuff	
who cares	
and how's it any different from what you do	
excuse me	
i've seen you around them	
are you pretending like you don't do the exact same thing	
okay, lady,	
you are way out of line	
i'm out of line	
yeah, you're out of line	
what are you going to do about it,	
bitch	
i like green lantern	
i'm just saying it's pretty lame that he can be defeated by the color yellow	
only the modern green lantern is vulnerable to yellow	
golden age green lantern was vulnerable to wood	
great, so i can take them both out with a numbertwo pencil	
oh, my god girl fight	
what are you doing	
i know you	
you're stupid enough to break it up	
may i say you look very comely tonight	
thank you	
you're right,	
this filly's been broken	
you set it on dts, didn't you	
i had to	
she called me "cutie"	
according to alicia's facebook page,	
she's hooking up with one of the producers on csi	
dead whore on tv, live one in real life	
great	
now she's jumping	
up and down on the bed
