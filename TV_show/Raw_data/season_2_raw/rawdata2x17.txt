okay, raj	
hand me the #6 torx screwdriver	
stop	
we can't do this	
it's not right	
you have two choices either you let him put a bigger hard drive in the tivo, or you delete stuff before we go out of town	
but once you open the box, you've voided the warranty	
the warranty is a sacred covenant we've entered into with the manufacturer	
he offers to stand by his equipment,	
and we in return agree not to violate the integrity of the internal hardware	
this little orange sticker is all that stands between us and anarchy	
then we won't touch the hard drive	
we'll just erase the first season of battlestar	
there we're outlaws	
is this going to be big enough	
it's perfect for taking daffodils to your unicorn	
it's just for my notebooks	
thanks, penny	
i love san francisco	
i wish i was going with you	
i understand your envy	
this is a can'tmiss symposium	
there are going to be discussions on bioorganic cellular computer devices,	
the advancements in multithreaded task completion,	
plus a roundtable on the nonequilibrium green's function approach to the photoionization process in atoms	
when i go, i usually just get hammered and ride the cable cars	
this conference is kind of a big thing	
the keynote address is being delivered by george smoot	
oh, my god, the george smoot	
you've heard of him	
of course i haven't	
george smoot	
is a nobel prizewinning physicist,	
one of the great minds of our time	
his work in black body form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation cemented our understanding of the origin of the universe	
it's kind of a funny name, though "smoot"	
it's like talking to a chimp	
now that i've been completely insulted,	
have a good flight i wish	
we're not flying	
we're taking the train	
oh, cool	
yeah, cool	
seven times as long as flying, and costs almost twice as much	
then why are you doing it	
we had a vote	
three of us voted for airplane	
sheldon voted for train	
so we're taking the train	
don't say it like that	
say it like	
"we're taking the train"	
we're all going over to the apple store to make fun of the guys at the genius bar	
you want to come	
i always enjoy that, but i'm a little busy	
what are you doing	
i'm simplifying the task of packing for our trip	
see, by attaching rfid tags to my clothing,	
it will enable my laptop to read and identify the items	
with this wand i will then crossreference them against destination, anticipated activity spectrum, weather conditions, duration of trip, et cetera	
that does sound much simpler	
how long is this going to take	
assuming i can keep up this pace,	
three hours,  minutes	
plus however long it takes to conclude this fairly pointless conversation	
teasing the guys at the apple store seems a little redundant now	
i don't follow	
i wouldn't expect you to see you	
socks one pair,	
cotton, argyle, blue	
socks one pair,	
cotton, argyle, blue	
what on earth are you doing	
whatever it is,	
i'm guessing we're doing it wrong	
gentlemen, this is the coast starlight, one of the great american trains operating on one of the classic american routes	
on this side, you'll see panoramic ocean vistas inaccessible to any other form of transportation,	
while on your side, you'll be treated to  miles of costcos, jiffy lubes, and cinderblock homes with aboveground pools	
come on, raj	
what's wrong with jiffy lubes	
why not	
that's over the wheelbase	
are you completely unfamiliar with the suspension characteristics of a pre pullmanbuilt superliner deluxe passenger coach	
we've been on this train  seconds,	
and you've already said a thousand words	
just tell us where to sit	
and shut up	
here	
i'm hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards of the steady clickety-clack of steel wheels on polished rails, your sour disposition will abate	
yeah, maybe	
meanwhile, back in the st century, people are raising their tray tables and putting their seatbacks in an upright position	
'cause it's time to land in san francisco	
it's not so bad, really at least these trains have modern plumbing	
in india, you squat over a hole in the train and expose your naked buttocks to the chilly air of rajasthan	
he is referring, of course, to third class on indian railways' magnificent ranakpur express	
and its ,kilometer journey from maharashtra to the bikaner junction	
oh, look, now he's boring on an international scale	
holy crap look	
is that who i think it is	
it can't be	
what would summer glau be doing riding the train	
maybe john connor's aboard and she's protecting him from an evil terminator	
unlikely that's a television show	
thank you	
of course, if skynet actually did exist in the future,	
a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy mankind	
would be to send terminators back posing as actors	
who have played terminators in popular films and television series,	
lulling us into a false sense of security, ie, "that's summer glau	
from the sarah connor chronicles "no, summer, don't kill me i'm prorobot"	
at least he's off the train crap	
i owe you an apology taking the train was a stroke of brilliance	
i've actually got a shot at a terminator	
please	
when it comes to terminators, you've got a better shot of scoring with arnold schwarzenegger	
you're overlooking something	
i have hours with her in a confined space unless she's willing to jump off a moving train,	
tuck and roll down the side of a hill,	
she will eventually succumb to the acquired taste	
that is howard wolowitz	
my money's on tuck and roll	
i'm confused	
i thought you were involved in some sort of socially intimate pairing with leslie winkle	
let me explain to you how this works	
that's summer glau	
that's it	
hang on a sec	
why do you get first crack at her	
let's see, couple reasons	
one, i saw her first	
no, you didn't i did	
fair enough	
but then, let me move on to #	
unlike you, i can actually talk to women when i'm sober	
you fail to take into account that even mute, i am foreign and exotic,	
while you, on the other hand, are frail and pasty	
you know the old saying, "pasty and frail never fail"	
excuse me, but what about me	
why don't i get a shot	
fine, go ahead	
take a shot	
i've already got a gorgeous blonde back home that i can't score with	
i think i'll let you two take this one	
is there a place on this train to get alcohol	
interesting that you ask the coast starlight recently added the refurbished pacific parlour car built in  and originally known as the santa fe lounge car,	
the lower level is a theater and the upper level is a bar that offers wine tastings if you're going as far as portland	
so aren't you going to go talk to her	
i will, i'm just working on my opening line	
she's probably heard every possible line	
why don't you just try "hello"	
no, no,	
that always creeps girls out	
i need to come up with something that's funny, smart and delicately suggests that my sexual endowment	
is disproportionate to my physical stature	
you're going to need more than  hours	
oh, no	
what's the matter	
i forgot my flash drive	
so	
so we have to go back	
okay, i'm going to say "why"	
and your answer cannot be "because i forgot my flash drive"	
you don't understand	
my flash drive has my paper on astrophysical probes of mtheory effects in the early universe that i was going to give to george smoot at the conference	
why do you have to give your paper to george smoot	
it's brilliant	
he needs to read it	
so you'll send him an email when we get back	
then i won't get to see his face light up as he reads it	
right of course	
this is an unmitigated disaster	
there's nothing you can do about it,	
so relax, sit back, enjoy the clickety-clack of the steel wheels on the polished rails	
you forgot your flash drive,	
you forgot your flash drive	
only ten hours,  minutes to go	
it's hot in here must be summer	
so where you gals headed	
okay, i've found the perfect solution	
we get off the train at the next stop in oxnard	
we then take the  train	back to union station	
we take a cab back to the apartment, get my flash drive, and then race to san luis obispo,	
where, assuming the lights are with us and minimal traffic, we'll meet the train	
i've got a better idea	
are you going to be sarcastic	
you take all the fun	
out of it for me	
penny's homes	
why don't we call her, have her go in the apartment, get your flash drive and email you the paper	
but the flash drive is in a locked drawer in my desk	
so	
the key is hidden in my room	
so	
penny would have to go into my room	
so	
people don't go in my room	
i see it seems once again, you're caught between a rock and a crazy place	
i hate when that happens	
it's hot in here must be summer	
it's hot in here must be summer	
it's hot in here must be summer	
that's cute	
really i just made it up	
have you seen slumdog millionaire	
yeah, i loved it	
it's loosely based on my life	
we're putting the play on for one night in this little seat theater	
can you come	
oh, great	
do you know  other people that might want to come	
hang on	
listen carefully	
i'm about to give you a set of instructions which you must follow to the letter	
just a sec	
the theater is above a bowling alley, so it's a little noisy,	
but it might be the only chance i'll ever get to play anne frank and the director is brilliant	
he uses the bowling sounds as, like, nazi artillery great, i'll see you then	
hello	
okay, step four	
do you see that small plastic case	
on my dresser	
your dresser who is this	
it's sheldon	
hey, sheldon	
how is san francisco	
i'm not in san francisco	
i'm on a train	
were you even listening to me	
i was talking to my friend,	
but what's up	
what's up i'll tell you what's up	
i'm in a crisis situation,	
and i need you to marshal your powers of concentration, limited as they may be	
give me the phone	
hi, penny it's leonard	
hey, leonard	
what's going on with dr wackadoodle	
he's calling to ask you a favor	
you might be confused because he didn't use the words,	
"penny," "sheldon,"	
"please" or "favor"	
enough chitchat	
okay, step one	
locate your emergency key to our apartment	
step two	
enter our apartment	
step three	
enter my bedroom	
step four	
hang on, getting another call	
let me tell you	
personal robots cannot get here	
soon enough	
and that bright little star peeking her head out early today	
that's venus	
that is so cool	
you really know a lot about space	
come on	
when you were on tv in firefly,	
you were actually in space	
you're not one of those guys	
who really believe that, are you	
you mean one of the hopeless geeks	
those are crazy people	
howard, be a dear and get me another one of these	
now, him, he's one of those geeks	
all right, now, before you enter my bedroom unescorted,	
i need you to understand that this onetime grant of access does not create a permanent easement	
easement	
it's a legal right of access	
good grief	
what no, don't put me on hold	
do you believe him	
normally around women,	
he has the personality of a boiled potato	
put one beer in him,	
and he's m night charmalarmalon	
is that what he's drinking	
it's not even real beer	
what	
look	
"nonalcoholic beer"	
what's going on	
i don't know	
some sort of placebo effect, i guess	
placebo, you say	
interesting	
yes, i'm still here	
where am i going i'm on a train	
now, what you'll be looking for is a small wooden box located between a hoberman's sphere and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite	
hoberman's sphere	
it's a collapsible	
icosidodecahedron	
no, the thing with the time on it is my alarm clock	
actually, in india, the names of constellations are different	
where you have the big dipper, we have the big curry pot	
you're making that up	
you got me	
now what are you	
going to do with me	
look	
what am i looking at	
you tell me	
"nonalcoholic beer"	
hi i'm the small package	
good things come in	
i got a box,	
but there's no key in here just letters	
that's the wrong box	
put it back	
are these letters from your grandmother	
don't read those letters	
look, she calls you "moon pie"	
that is so cute	
put down the letters	
hey, penny it's leonard	
how's the train ride	
delightful	
i don't know what you're doing	
but there are little bubbles forming on the corners of sheldon's mouth	
yeah, i kind of crossed a line	
put him back on	
thank you	
i'm back	
what up, moon pie	
no one calls me moon pie but meemaw	
hey, penny leonard again	
in the dream, you and i were ice skating, just the two of us	
and then, i picked you up by your ankles	
and twirled you round and round until your legs tore off	
i tried to stick them back on,	
but before i could, you turned into a giant loaf of pumpernickel bread	
what do you think that means	
i really don't know	
i'll give you a clue	
my favorite sandwich salami on pumpernickel	
is that so	
did you know "pumpernickel" comes from the german words	
"pumper" and "nickel,"	
which loosely translates to "fart goblin"	
i didn't	
okay, i found the box now what	
you're holding a japanese puzzle box, which takes ten precise moves to open	
first, locate the panel	
with the diamond pattern	
and slide the center portion	
one millimeter to the left	
then, on the opposite end of the box,	
slide the entire panel down	
two millimeters	
you'll hear a slight click	
hang on	
do you have any emotional attachment to this box	
no, it's a novelty	
i ordered off the internet	
did you hear the click	
not yet	
there it is	
okay, here's another one	
if you married the famous rock guitarist johnny winter, you'd be summer winter	
i'm going to just go for broke here	
and say i like you	
so here's my question	
do you realistically see any conversational path	
that would take us from where we are right now to a place where i could ask you out	
and you'd say yes	
fair enough	
i'll leave you in peace	
thank you	
but before i go,	
would you mind if i take one picture of us together for my facebook page	
sure	
great now, can i take one where it looks like we're making out	
now you're going to insert the flash drive into the usb port	
she calls me moon pie	
because i'm nummynummy	
and she could just eat me up	
now, please put the flash drive in the usb port	
the one that looks like a little duck's mouth	
how'd it go	
terminator broke my phone	
excuse me	
i'll be honest with you	
i've just spent the last two hours imaging various scenarios in my head, trying to come up with some clever line to say to you	
but i finally realized you're a human being	
i'm a human being	
i could just say	
next stop santa barbara	
i'm sorry this is me	
hi, my name's leonard	
so, i'm thinking, you won the nobel prize what, three years ago	
so you must deal with a whole lot of "what has smoot done lately"	
my thought is we continue my research as a team	
you know, coopersmoot, alphabetical and when we win the nobel prize, you'll be back on top	
with all due respect, dr cooper, are you on crack	
fine	
smootcooper	
what a diva
