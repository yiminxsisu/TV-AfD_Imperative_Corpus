the problem appears to be unsolvable	
maybe we could run some computer simulations	
there are too many variables	
it would take forever	
we've got to be missing something	
let's start again	
the movie is playing here at , here at , here at  and here at	
these theaters have to be eliminated	
why they're stateoftheart digital projection, channel surround sound	
yes, but they have no icee machines despite my aggressive letterwriting campaign, i might add	
what about the multiplex here	
the seats are terrific	
they have twizzlers nstead of red vines	
no amount of lumbar support	 can compensate for that	
it's gonna take at least an hour to eat,	
and i don't see a sheldonapproved restaurant proximate to a sheldonapproved theater	
we could eat after the movie	
unacceptable	
the delay would result in tomorrow's bowel movement occurring at work	
hang on, hang on	
there's a eleven here	
we smuggle slurpees,	
which are essentially icees, in under our coats,	
after having a pleasant meal either here, here or here	
i don't see how we missed that	
excuse me, in what universe are slurpees icees	
that's how we missed it	
sheldon, would you be prepared, on a nonprecedential basis, to create an emergency ad hoc slurpeeicee equivalency	
you know i can't do that	
i guess we only have one option	
i don't see any way around it	
bye, sheldon	
see ya	
they're right,	
it was the only option	
shut the door	
why	
just do it	
get inside and shut the door	
well, you didn't specify	
is leonard around	
he went to the movies without me	
it was the only option	
i'm sorry, i don't understand	
which social situation this is	
could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed	
the building manager's showing an apartment downstairs,	
and i haven't paid my rent	
oh, i see	
i'm not sure i'm comfortable harboring a fugitive	
from the  north	
los robles corporation	
it's no big deal	
i'm just a little behind on my bills	
because they cut back my hours at the restaurant and my car broke down	
if you recall, i pointed out the "check engine" light	
to you several months ago	
the "check engine" light is fine	
it's still blinking away	
it's the stupid engine	
that stopped working	
it cost me like $, to fix it	
it occurs to me you could solve all	
your problems by obtaining more money	
yes, it occurs to me, too	
hang on a moment	
here take some	
pay me back when you can	
you got a lot of money in there	
that's why it's guarded by snakes	
take some	
don't be silly	
i'm never silly	
here	
no, i can't	
don't you need money	
yeah, but	
this is money i'm not using	
but what if you need it	
my expenses account for % of my aftertax income	
the rest is divvied up between a small savings account,	
this deceptive container of peanut brittle and the hollowedout buttocks of a superhero action figure	
who shall remain nameless	
for his own protection	
or her own protection	
take some	
really i mean, are you sure	
i see no large upcoming expenditures	
unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton	
with adamantium like wolverine	
are they working on that	
i sincerely hope so	
well, thank you	
no, i can't	
honey, i don't want things to be weird between us	
won't it also be weird if i have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work	
and you're living in a refrigerator box and washing your hair with rain water	
i'll pay you back as soon as i can	
of course you will	
it's impossible to pay me back	
sooner than you can	
assuming you subscribe to a linear understanding of time and causality	
i'm regretting this already	
i've given the matter some thought,	
and i think i'd be willing to be a house pet to a race of superintelligent aliens	
interesting	
ask me why	
do i have to	
of course that's how	
you move a conversation forward	
why	
the learning opportunities would be abundant	
additionally, i like having my belly scratched	
hey, penny how was work	
great	
i hope i'm a waitress at the cheesecake factory for my whole life	
was that sarcasm	
was that sarcasm	
was that sar	
stop it	
you appear to have a package here	
oh, thanks	
this must be the beret i ordered a couple of months ago	
it was backordered	
did you know the beret is an example of a piece of women's fashion adapted from male military uniforms	
another fascinating example is the epaulet	
he's not lying	
he does find that fascinating	
whatever it's not like i'm running up and down the streets just buying myself berets	
i bought one a month ago,	
and it was backordered	
look, it finally arrived, all right	
all right	
oh, my god, would you just get off my case	
weird	
good, that was an unusual interaction	
i wasn't sure	
did you guys have an argument	
no	
you clearly did something to aggravate her	
i'm at a loss	
if you like, you can review	
my daily log of social interactions and see if there's a blunder i overlooked	
here you go	
you owe me another two dollars	
the price of moo shu pork went up	
it's getting tougher and tougher to be a bad jew	
here you go, penny	
shrimp with lobster sauce	
thank you what's my share	
don't worry about it it's my treat	
really, how much	
whatever $, $	
which is it, $ or $	
$ but it's no biggie	
you'll get the next one	
what	
he was just wondering if he wore skintight jeans and a tank top	
if he'd get his shrimp lo mein for free	
what are you saying	
that i'm using my body to get dinner	
that i'm some kind of chinese food prostitute	
yeah, raj, what are you saying	
let me tell you something	
i pay my own way in this world, okay	
i don't rely on anybody	
what was that about	
he has a nervous bladder when he's stressed out kind of like a puppy	
here, leonard	
$, $, $ $	
it was $, but it's okay	
oh, good	
dinner's here	
yes, and i'm having some	
i'm having takeout food	
you're damn right it's okay i've been having leftovers at the restaurant for like four days,	
and i wanted something different so sue me	
forgive me, but that would be the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit	
i will pay you back as soon as i can	
you just have to give me more time	
you lent her money	
she need money	
you seem under pressure	
did i not lend you a sufficient amount	
because i can give you more	
you know, you would just	
love that, wouldn't you	
you would just love to open up your little snake can and throw some money at the girl who can't pay her bills	
where are you going	
going home,	
where i won't be interrogated like a criminal	
i forgot my fortune cookie	
in case either of you have larceny in your heart,	
you should know that i've moved	
my money out of the snake can	
but if you're ever short, there's always a couple of s in green lantern's ass	
hey	
hey	
a little mood lighting, huh	
when i didn't pay my bill,	
the department of water and power thought i would enjoy the ambience	
yeah, they're very considerate	
that way	
i used sheldon's money to pay my rent	
then i had like $ left over	
$, huh	
put it back in your pocket,	
or i'll find some other place to put it	
back in the pocket it goes	
you do understand	
sheldon really doesn't care	
when he gets the money back	
it's actually	
one of the few idiosyncrasies	
that doesn't make you want to kill him	
yeah, well, that's not really	
my big problem	
so you're a little behind on your bills	
everybody gets behind on their bills	
i know, it's just	
this wasn't the plan	
it wasn't supposed to go this way	
what was the plan	
waitress for six months	
and then become a movie star	
was there a plan b	
tv star	
it's probably not as bad as you think	
let's take a look	
maybe we can find	
some corners to cut	
here's something	
if you don't have electricity,	
then you probably don't need cable	
just a suggestion	
$ dollars for acting classes	
no, i can't give up my acting classes	
i'm a professional actress	
you've had an acting job	
where you got paid	
that is not the definition of professional	
actually, it kind of	
let's keep looking	
what's $, to the los angeles county superior court	
that's nothing	
nothing	
it sounds like you got caught speeding going , miles an hour	
remember kurt	
your exboyfriend	
he got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car	
what	
he was drunk	
i would hope so	
he had a bunch of outstanding tickets	
and a bench warrant,	
so i, you know, i paid his fines	
did he pay you back	
no, but he will	
and that's based on the inherent creditworthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles	
leonard, i'm not gonna call up kurt and ask him for money	
what are you gonna do	
i don't know,	
but i may have to find a cheaper place to live	
you don't want to do that	
why not	
moving is a big deal	
you have to go to the supermarket and get boxes,	
and if they're not clean,	
your books smell like melons,	
and it's like	
why don't you just get a roommate and stay here	
do you know anybody	
i'm sure the guy living with sheldon wouldn't mind moving in with you	
leonard, honey,	
if we started living together,	
i wouldn't be able to keep my hands off you	
really	
and you thought my acting lessons were a waste of money	
this moo shu pork's burning	
a hole through my duodenum	
leviticus	
"only that which parteth the hoof and cheweth the cud among the beasts shall ye eat"	
do i mock you with the bhagavadgita	
every time you scarf down a whopper	
what's going on	
we're on a quest through the valley of fire to acquire the sacred crown	
you want the valley of fire	
it's right here	
you guys want to go on a real live quest	
outside i just made cocoa	
come on it'll be fun	
what is it	
do you guys remember penny's exboyfriend kurt	
yeah, that's him	
turns out he owes penny a lot of money,	
and i'm gonna go get it from him	
who's with me	
double sixes	
really you're just gonna	
let me go by myself	
cool, i got a sword	
i could use some help	
here	
you guys are unbelievable	
you play a game	to simulate adventure,	
but when there's real adventure out there in the real world, you just wimp out	
do you not recall the last time we visited this gentleman,	
we returned home without pants	
i do	
are you sure	
because your proposal suggests that you don't	
i'm not afraid of him	
all right	
leonard fairly calls the question	
who is in favor of abandoning our game	
and confronting penny's steroidinfused exboyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him	
say hi to kurt for us	
excuse me	
when frodo left the shire to take the one ring to mordor,	
didn't samwise, pippin and merry go with him	
they did	
well	
they had a terrible time of it	
plus, no one stole their pants	
fine	
enjoy your little game	
i'll make this quest on my own	
wait	
take a jacket	
it's shpritzing a little	
you guys suck	
come on, please he's so big	
is everyone clear on the plan	
koothrappali's going to wet himself,	
i'm gonna throw up,	
sheldon's gonna run away,	
and you're going to die	
shall we synchronize our watches	
guys, there are four of us and one of him	
which means his triumph will be even larger	
minstrels will write songs about him	
how about this i'll do the talking	
you just stand behind me and try to look formidable	
i should've peed before we left	
hi, kurt	
lenny, right	
i don't really go by lenny,	
but that's okay	
you remember sheldon, howard and raj	
what do you want	
you don't remember me	
how could he not rember me	
not now	
i remember him	
here it is	
penny's in kind of a financial jam,	
and the money that you owe her would go a long way to solving her problems	
she sent you to get it from me	
no, no, she's too proud to ask for the money	
i, on the other hand, feel you should honor your debt	
you do	
"feel" is a kind of a	
it's a strong word	
i just think it would be a nice gesture on your part	
she'll get it when she gets it	
well, there you go	
problem solved	
a successful quest now let's go find a gas station with a clean bathroom	
no, the problem isn't solved	
he just blew us off	
i've got it	
he didn't remember me	
because the last time we met, i was in a halloween costume	
come on, leonard, let's go	
you can leave if you want to	
i'm gonna see this through	
i guess, technically, that was my fault	
i'm not leaving here without penny's money	
what happened to your backup	
i don't need backup	
i have right on my side	
and i'm wearing cargo shorts under my pants	
congratulations	
you may not have succeed in getting cash,	
but you did secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt	
maybe we should have your head notarized	
if anybody cares,	
i still have to pee	
is sheldon here	
hang on	
nice hat	
it's kind of a fashionable look these days	
maybe if you're working	
on a tuna boat	
hello, penny	
sheldon, here is your money	
thank you very much	
it helped a lot	
sarcasm	
darn i can't seem to get the hang of that	
i know it's none of my business,	
but where did the money come from	
well, i cut back my expenses	
like you said and picked up a few more hours at the restaurant,	
but the biggest thing was,	
out of the blue, kurt shows up and gives me the money he owes me	
really	
did he say why	
he said he was feeling guilty	
and wanted to do what was right	
that's it	
did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany	
i just think he's really changed	
we're having dinner tomorrow night,	
and i get to wear my new beret	
bye, guys	
well done, leonard	
the true hero doesn't seek adulation	
he fights for right and justice simply because it's his nature	
penny's hooking up with her jerk of an exboyfriend,	
and i have indelible ink on my forehead	
that's your badge of honor	
your warrior's wound, if you will	
i was wrong	
minstrels will write songs about you	
great	
there once was a brave lad named leonard with a fifi fiddle deedee	
he faced a fearsome giant while raj just wanted to pee
