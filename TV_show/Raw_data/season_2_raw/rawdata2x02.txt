worst	
renaissance	
fair	
ever	
please let it go, sheldon	
it was rife with historical inaccuracies	
for example, the tavern girl serving flagons of mead	
her costume was obviously germanic	
but in 
at best, they would have had some sort of spiced wine	
you're nitpicking	
oh, really	
well, here's another nit for you: the flagonswould not have been made of polypropylene	
renaissance fairs aren't about historical accuracy	
they're about taking chubby girls who work at kinko'sand lacing them up in corsets so tighttheir bosom jumps out and says, howdy	
bosoms would not have said howdy in the 
if anything, they would've said, huzzah	
i don't care what the bosoms say	
i just want to be part of the conversation	
hi, guys	
looks like you've been to the renaissance fair	
i'm hoping	
renaissance fair	
more of a medieval, slash, age of enlightenment,slash, any-excuse-to-wear-a-codpiece fair	
okay, fine, whatever	
this is my friend eric	
hello	
hey	
so, yeah, good to see you	
it's good to see you, too	
we should probably go	
bye, guys	
i like your hat	
thanks, my mom made it	
penny with a new guy, tr√®s awkward	
it wasn't awkward	
it wasn't fun	
besides, what's the big deal	
we dated, we stopped dating, and now we're both moving on	
by moving on, do you mean she's going out with other menand you spent the afternoon making 
that was not 
my god, those people need to learn you can't just put "ye olde" in front of anything you want and expect to get away with it	
can we please just go in	
my chain mail's stuck in my underwear	
you're wearing modern underwear	
relatively modern	
what are you wearing	
i fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen	
you bought linen	
don't be silly	
i borrowed one of your pillowcases	
borrowed	
i'm happy that penny's moving on	
it gives me the freedom to move on myself	
are you saying that you've been holding back	
of course	
out of respect	
so, how do you explain the ten years before penny	
who were you respecting then	
well, i've dated plenty of women	
there was joyce kim	
leslie winkle	
notify the editors of the oxford english dictionary	
the word "plenty" has been redefined to mean two	
what about that girl last year at comic-con	
doesn't count	
why not	
what happens in costume at comic-con stays at comic-con	
you're saying that because of what happened to you	
what happened to you	
nothing happened to me	
it wasn't your fault	
he was dressed as a green orion slave girl	
how did we get on me	
we were mocking leonard for not moving on	
dude, you have totally not moved on	
yes, i have	
it's just a matter of actually making a date with someone	
like who	
well, there's joyce kim	
but she defected back to north korea, so	
it's a little geographically undesirable	
what about leslie winkle	
oh, no	
why	
her research methodology is sloppy,she's unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity,and to make matters worse, she's often mean to me	
i think she's smoking hot	
i'd hit that	
you'd hit particulate soil in a colloidal suspension	
mud	
i like leslie, but she's not interested in datingas much as using men as tools for stress release	
yeah, so	
be a tool	
go get yourself a little rebound stress release	
technically, it would only be rebound if he and pennyhad actually engaged in physical intimacy	
like you and richard the slave girl	
i bought him dinner and we kissed once	
that was it	
and he told me his name was kimberly	
you know how i know we're not in the matrix	
how	
if we were, the food would be better	
hey, leonard	
hey, leslie	
hey, dummy	
hello, to you	
insufficiently intelligent person	
ooh, rush me to the burn unit	
do you have a second	
i need to ask you something	
sure	
if you'll excuse me,i'm going to go do workthat promises significant results, as opposed to what you do,which does not	
yeah, you heard me	
so, i heard your relationship with penny crashed to the groundlike blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory	
where did you hear that	
actually, i read it	
wolowitz texted me	
like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory, yeah	
i thought it was a pretty good one	
i gave him an lol	
anyway, it got me thinking	
now that you're unattached,maybe we can revisit our previous attachment	
are you suggesting another bout of stress release	
no, i'm all done with casual sex	
from now on, i'm fully committedto the traditional relationship paradigm	
really	
what changed	
it's hard to say	
i guess there's a time in every woman's lifewhen she gets tired of waking up on a strange futonwith a bunch of people she doesn't know	
yeah, i can see how that would-- a bunch of people	
anyway, i figure it's time to slow things down and,who better to slow things down with than you	
i'm flattered	
so,how do you suggest we proceed	
your place, we'll order chinese,you'll rent a movieartsy, but accessible then light petting, no coitus	
sounds fun	
i'll leave the details up to you	
it's better if you assume the male role	
thank you, that's very thoughtful	
great	
call me	
great news	
my mom sent me my old nintendo 64	
terrific	
you know what this means, don't you	
break out the red bull, it's time to rock mario, old school	
i kind of have other plans tonight	
but it's friday	
friday's always vintage game night	
look, mom included the memory card	
we can pick up right where i left off in 
the thing is, someone's coming over	
no problem	
i have three controllers	
the more the merrier	
it's a date	
i have a date coming over	
you can't blame me for not jumping to that conclusion	
why	
what's so unusual about me having a date	
statistically speaking,all right, all right	
nevertheless, i have one now and i'd appreciate it if you would,make yourself scarce	
i'm a published theoretical physicist with two doctoratesand an iq which can't be accurely measured by normal tests	
how much scarcer could i be	
you know what i mean	
could you just give us a little privacy	
you want me to leave the apartment	
yes	
you mean, just go someplace else and be someplace else	
yes	
why should i leave	
this is my apartment, too	
i know,and if science ever discovers a second member of your speciesand you two would like some privacy,i'd be more than happy to get out of your way	
well, all right then	
what are you doing	
playing super marioon a poorly coded nintendo 64 emulator	
why are you doing it on the stairs	
i am a modern day napoleon exiled to the elba of the staircasebecause leonard, get this, has a date	
good for him	
why are you sitting here	
why don't you just go to a movie or something	
alone	
yeah, why not	
what if i choke on my popcorn	
who will administer the heimlich maneuver	
then don't order popcorn	
no popcorn at the mo listen to yourself	
why don't you go to a coffee shop	
i don't drink coffee	
they have other things	
what do they have	
you know, cookies, pastries	
pastries such as bear claws	
yeah, sure	
i don't like bear claws	
hey, penny	
dumbass	
leslie winkle	
of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world,why does it have to be leslie winkle	
they have a lot in common	
i mean, they're both scientists	
oh, please	
the only way she could make a contribution to sciencewould be if they resumed sending chimps into space	
okay, well, i have a date, too, so i'll see ya	
everybody has a date	
even you, mario, going after princess peach	
and what am i doing	
i'm just enabling you	
this is pretty good orange chicken	
yeah, it's from chang's	
not chow's	
no, chang's	
what happened to chow's	
it changed	
so,how many childrendo you think we should have	
i'm sorry	
that was a little abrupt	
a little	
there are so many things to talk aboutbefore we discuss reproduction	
i sure hope so	
besides shortness, what genetic weaknesses run in your family	
sorry to interrupt	
battery's dying	
continue	
genetic weakness, right	
there's the lactose intolerance	
don't forget the male-pattern baldness	
when his uncles sit around the dinner table,they look like a half carton of eggs	
okay, my uncles are bald,but my aunt edna is one of the hairiest women you'll ever meet	
sweet lady	
always tickles when she hugs me	
what now	
i have to make pee-pee	
i'm sorry about all of sheldon's interruptions	
he can be a bit of an eccentric	
if by "eccentric" you mean passive-aggressiveeast texas blowhole, i agree	
i think tonight was a very good start	
me, too	
you sure you're okay postponing intercourseuntil our relationship is past the initial viability test	
no problem, i'm very skilled at postponing intercourse	
i guess i'll call you and we'll arrange another evening	
i believe protocol dictates you wait a minimum of 
sure	
again, it's your decision	
you're the man	
it wasn't my cat	
it was an experiment designed by this guy named schroedinger	
from the charlie brown cartoons	
no, he was some kind of scientist	
let me start again	
hey, leonard	
hello	
leslie	
hi	
okay, well, good night	
okay, good night	
that ain't gonna make your point	
that's enough	
call me	
right	
okay, good night	
what	
had a great time	
ciao	
i'm sorry, i am not going back to the renaissance fair	
come on,there's so few places i can wear my jester costume	
i don't care	
there are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort	
okay, how about this	
you can go dressed as a star trek science officerexploring a planet similar to earth in the 
you mean, like spock	
sure	
fascinating	
hey, fellow scientists why don't we all move over there so leslie can join us	
let's do it	
if you're having trouble deciding where to sit,may i suggest one potato, two potato	
or as i call it, the leslie winkle experimental methodology	
don't make this hard for me	
it's not hard	
it's simple	
you can either sit with me, your friend, colleague and roommateor with an overrated scientist you might have sex with	
you're right, it is simple	
hey, sheldon	
penny	
third floor tonight mixing it up	
i still don't understand why you don't go to dinner or something	
all right,let's say i go to dinner alone,and during the meal, i have to use the restroom	
how do i know someone's not touching my food	
good night, sheldon	
penny, hold on	
are you sure things can't work out with you and leonard	
excuse me	
i'm just wonderingif you really gave it the old college try	
or in your case, the old community college try	
okay, where is this coming from	
leonard is upstairs right now with my archenemy	
your archenemy	
the dr	
doom to my mr	
fantastic	
the dr	
octopus to my spider-man, the dr	
sivana to my captain marvel	
i get it	
it's amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees	
graduate school should do a better job of screening those people out	
sheldon, come back	
you're losing me	
it's leslie winkle, penny	
she belittles my research	
sweetie, i'm sorry	
she called me dumbass	
i know	
i heard	
given this situation,i have no choice but to withdraw my previous objectionsto your ill-considered relationship with leonard	
gee, well, thank you for that	
but i think for now,leonard and i are just gonna stay friends	
no, that response is unacceptable to me	
sheldon, you area smart guy	
i'm smart	
i'd have to lose 6
are you gonna let me talk	
i'm sorry	
you must know that if leonardand leslie want to be together,nothing you can do is gonna stop it	
you continue to underestimate my capabilities, madam	
let me put it this way	
if you're really leonard's friend,you will support him no matter who he wants to be with	
wait a minute	
why am i doing all the giving here	
if leonard's really my friend, why doesn't he have to support meand my hatred of leslie winkle	
because love trumps hate	
now you're just making stuff up	
okay, good night, sheldon	
mario	
if only i could control everyone the way i control you	
hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop	
when the two of you reach a natural stopping point,i'd like to have a word	
if the word is pee-pee, just do it	
leonard, you're my friend,and friends support their friends apparently	
so i'm withdrawing my objectionto your desire to have a relationship with leslie	
thank you	
i will graciouslyoverlook the fact that she is an arrogant,subpar scientist who actually believes loop quantum gravitybetter unites quantum mechanics with general relativitythan does string theory	
you kids have fun	
hang on a second	
loop quantum gravity clearly offers more testable predictions than string theory	
i'm listening	
amuse me	
for one thing, we expect quantized space-time to manifest itselfas minute differences in the speed of light for different colors	
balderdash	
matter clearly consists of tiny strings	
are you gonna let him talk to me like that	
okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories	
no, there isn't	
only loop quantum gravitycalculates the entropy of black holes	
sheldon, don't make that noise	
it's disrespectful	
i should hope so	
it was a snort of derision	
you agree with me, right	
loop quantum gravity is the future of physics	
sorry, leslie, i guess i prefer my space stringy, not loopy	
i'm glad i found out the truth about you before this went any further	
truth	
what truth	
we're talking about untested hypothes	
it's no big deal	
it isn't	
really	
tell me, how will we raise the children	
i guess we wait until they're old enough and let them choose their own theory	
we can't let them choose	
they're children	
where are you going	
i'm sorry	
i could have accepted our kids being genetically unable to eat ice cream or ever get a good view of a parade	
but this	
this is a deal breaker	
look on the bright side	
what's the bright side	
only nine more months to comic-con	
captain, i'm getting an unusual reading	
that's great	
you guys want corn dogs	
that's a temporal anomaly	
corn dog's didn't come into existence till the first half of the 2
