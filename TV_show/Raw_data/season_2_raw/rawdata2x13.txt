gentlemen, i put it to you	
the worst tapioca pudding	
is better than the best pudding of any other flavor	
first off, that is axiomatically wrong	
because the best pudding is chocolate	
secondly, the organic structure of tapioca makes it a jiggling bowl	
of potential death	
it is extracted from the plant	
i'm thinking of growing a mustache	
no kidding fu manchu,	
a handlebar, pencil	
it's extracted from	
i'm not sure yet	
george clooney has one now	
really	
i once saw him shopping at ralph's	
he was buying tequila	
you'd thinka guy like that would have some kind of booze lackey	
this is cruel	

all right, why is tap	
tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant manihot esculenta	
due to a high concentration of cyanide, it is poisonous in its raw form	
and lethal if prepared improperly	
feel better now	
it is also indigenous to brazil	
as is the cocoa bean,	
from which we get chocolate, the best pudding	
you promised	
you wouldn't do that anymore	
hey, hofstadter	
hey, kripke	
heard about your latest antiproton decay experiment	
, data runs	
and no statistically significant results very impressive	
what a jerk	
don't feel bad	
negative results are still results	
even , of them	
all right	
please don't cheer me up anymore	
don't let him get to you	
it's kripke	
he's a ginormous knob	
that's why he eats by himself instead of sitting here at the cool table for shizzle	
it's true kripke lacks the basic social skills that we take for granted	
but he also controls the new open science grid computer	
that i need to use to run some simulations of structure formation	
in the early universe	
good luck getting time on it	
the only people he lets use it are his friends	
then the solution is simple	
i shall befriend him	
what would you say to the idea of you and i becoming friends	
i would say i have no interest in becoming your friend	
really	
that seems rather shortsighted	
coming from someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable	
why don't you take some time to reconsider	
yeah, i'll do that	
i think we're off to a terrific start	
there you go	
now any email from wolowitz	
will go right into your spam folder	
thanks	
the email doesn't bother me as much as the vacation pictures of him	
in a bathing suit	
yeah, i got the same one,	
and that's not a bathing suit	
it's a tan line	
hello,	
this is sheldon cooper	
i am leaving a message for barry kripke	
it was pleasant	
seeing you today in the cafeteria	
i saw that you purchased the chef's salad	
apparently, you did not know	
that the chef's salad is kitchen trickery to utilize scrap meat	
nevertheless,	
i hope you enjoyed it	
i'm following up on our pending friendship	
and i look forward to hearing from you regarding its status	
sheldon cooper	
what's up with ichabod	
he's trying to make a new friend	
really	
well, good for him	
unless he makes one out of wood like geppetto,	
i don't think it's gonna happen	
how did you guys become friends	
there was a flyer on the bulletin board at the university	
"roommate wanted whistlers need not apply"	
and you moved in anyway	
i assumed he was joking	
you'd be surprised how many particle physicists have a whimsical side	
what about howard and raj	
how did he become friends with them	
i don't know	
how do carbon atoms form a benzene ring	
proximity and valence electrons	
well, sure,	
when you put it that way	
but it all worked out, right	
i suppose	
i do miss whistling, though	
oh, come on really	
first warning	
this is for you	
hello, sheldon	
hi	
what is this	
it's a questionnaire i devised	
i'm having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work	
so i'm doing a little research	
to better understand why my current friends like me	
yes, well, that is a good question	
but is this really the best way to figure it out	
i agree	
the social sciences are largely hokum but short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring your response	
to my companionship,	
this is the best i can do	
okay, "question one	
"rank the following aspects of sheldon cooper "in order of appeal	
intelligence	
"ruthless attention to hygiene	
playfulness	
java applet writing"	
i know, i may have started out with a fairly obvious one	
an aspect of my most appealing trait	
playfulness	
go ahead and rank that number one	
i'm afraid you're on your own for the rest	
it should take you no more than three hours	
wait how many questions	
are on this thing	
only	
don't worry	
in deference to you, i kept them all	
at a high school graduate	
reading level	
thanks, pal	
you got it buddy	
honey, did you ever consider	
making friends by being,	
i don't know, pleasant	
that's certainly a thoughtprovoking hypothesis	
may i suggest it as the topic for your essay	
your questionnaire,	
very disappointing	
i answered every question	
you answered the multiple choice questions in a pattern	
abbac	
abbac	
oh, you picked up on that	
how could i not	
come on	
there's over  questions	
and look at some of these things	
"sheldon is to camaraderie as the space shuttle is to blank"	
there are a number of acceptable answers	
for example,	
"c nearearth transport"	
but certainly not	
"b avocado rancher"	
and your essay suggesting that i'd have better luck	
making friends if i wait till the cylons take over	
please	
hold on	
i put some real work into that	
yes, well, it's better than what wolowitz did	
he drew a raccoon with what appears to be  distended scrotum	
it's kinda cute	
until you get to the scrotum	
what hope do i have	
for establishing new relationships	
given that my current friends	
apparently could not take a few hours out of their lives to help me	
i'm not going to defend	a bigballed raccoon	
i don't see how you could	
what i'm trying to say is that maybe you can't approach this s a purely intellectual exercise	
what do you mean	
remember when you tried to learn how to swim using the internet	
i did learn how to swim on the floor	
the skills are transferable	
i just have no interest in going in the water	
then why learn how to swim	
the ice caps are melting	
in the future, swimming isn't going to be optional	
but you do bring up	
an interesting point	
i don't have to break new ground here	
i'm sure much of the research already exists	
no, no, my point is,	
if you want to learn how to make friends,	
then just go out to a coffee shop or a museum	
meet people talk to them	
take an interest in their lives	
that's insane on the face of it	
where are we going	
you're driving me to the mall	
i'm going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories	
in the field of friendmaking	
why don't you just lie down on the floor and swim there	
coping with the death of a loved one	
my condolences	
thank you	
family or friend	
family	
too bad	
if it had been a friend,	
i'm available to fill the void	
it's just as well	
she smelled like mothballs	
if you're gonna start sniffing people,	
i'm gonna go get a hot pretzel	
excuse me	
do you have any books about making friends	
yeah, but they're all for little kids	
i assume the skills can be extrapolated and transferred	
i guess	
they're right over there by the wooden train set	
i love trains	
i bet you do	
my, that's awfully sticky	
all right, let's see	
bernie bunny has two daddies now	
that's probably about homosexual rabbits	
gerry the gerbil	
and the bullies on the bus	
read it not helpful	
here we go	
stu the cockatoo is new at the zoo	
"author sarah carpenter	
lives in fort wayne, indiana	
"with her husband	
and best friend, mark,	
and their cockatoo stu" hardly makes her an expert in making friends, wouldn't you agree	
i don't like birds they scare me	
me, too	
most people don't see it	
what are you reading	
curious george	
i do like monkeys	
curious george is a monkey	
somewhat anthropomorphized, but yes	
say,	
maybe sometime you and i could go see monkeys together	
would you like that	
okay	
what are you doing	
i'm making friends with this little girl	
what's your name	
rebecca	
hi, rebecca	
i'm your new friend, sheldon	
no, you're not	

we were really hitting it off	
don't look up there's cameras	
i'm curious in the "how well do you know sheldon" section,	
what did you put for his favorite amino acid	
lysine	
damn it, i had lysine and changed it	
good, you're just in time	
i believe i've isolated the algorithm for making friends	
sheldon, there is no algorithm for making friends	
hear him out	
if he's really onto something,	
we could open a booth at comiccon	
make a fortune	
see, my initial approach to kripke had the same deficiencies	
as those that plagued stu the cockatoo	
when he was new at the zoo	
stu the cockatoo	
he's new at the zoo	
it's a terrific book	
i've distilled its essence into a simple flow chart	
that will guide me through the process	
have you thought about putting him in a crate	
while you're out of the apartment	
hello, kripke sheldon cooper here	
it occurred to me you hadn't returned any of my calls	
because i hadn't offered any concrete suggestions	
for pursuing our friendship	
perhaps the two of us might share a meal together	
i see	
well, then perhaps you'd have time for a hot beverage	
popular choices include	
tea, coffee, cocoa	
i see	
no, wait don't hang up yet	
what about a recreational activity	
i bet we share	
some common interests	
tell me an interest of yours	
really	
on actual horses	
tell me another interest of yours	
i'm sorry i have no desire to get in the water till i absolutely have to tell me another interest of yours	
he's stuck in an infinite loop	
i can fix it	
interesting, but isn't ventriloquism	
by definition a solo activity	
tell me another interest of yours	
is there any chance you like monkeys	
what is wrong with you	
everybody likes monkeys	
hang on, kripke	
a loop counter and an escape to the least objectionable activity	
howard, that's brilliant	
i'm surprised you saw that	
gee, why can't sheldon make friends	
all right, kripke, that last interest	
strikes me as the least objectionable,	
and i would like to propose that we do that together	
tomorrow	
yes, i'll pay	
all right, goodbye	
all right	
time to learn rock climbing	
you know, i am a fan of ventriloquism	
maybe you, me and your dummy could go get a hot beverage	
he could talk while you drink	
nope i wanna climb some rocks	
this appears significantly more monolithic than it did on my laptop	
one expects to see hominids	
learning to use bones as weapons	
you afraid of heights, cooper	
hardly	
a fear of heights is illogical	
a fear of falling, on the other hand, is prudent and evolutionary	
what would you say is	
the minimum altitude i need to achieve to cement our newfound friendship	
they have birthday parties here	
little kids climb this	
little kid hominids perhaps	
so is this your entire job	
your parents must be so proud	
let's go, cooper	
i'm coming, kripke	
the harness seems to be secure	
a small amount of incontinence	
just now,	
but the web site said that's to be expected	
this isn't so bad	
it's like vertical swimming	
look at you	
you're almost halfway to the top	
i am	
i was wrong	
it is a fear of heights	
you all right there, cooper	
not really	
i feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function	
that's approached an asymptote	
are you saying you're stuck	
what part of inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote did you not understand	
i understood all of it	
i'm not a moron	
just keep going	
yeah, i don't think i can	
well, then climb back down	
no, that doesn't seem any more likely	
what's your plan	
well, it's not exactly a plan,	
but i think i'm going to pass out	
sorry, can we please just do it one more time	
one, two, one, two, three, and	
it's a little thing,	
but you really do miss it	
hello, everyone	
i brought my new friend	
barry kripke home for dinner	
hello to you, too	
how was rock climbing	
he passed out	
just hung there like a big salami	
that's where i sit	
you have a special spot	
what kind of wacko are you	
how much time you got	
you want some chinese food	
terrific got any dental floss in the bathroom	
be right back	
i got to floss the indian food out of my teeth	
if i'm gonna eat chinese	
sheldon, are you okay	
yes, i pass out all the time,	
but it was worth it	
i've made substantial progress in bonding with kripke,	
which brings me to an awkward moment	
what's that	
maintaing five friendships promises to be a herculean task, so	
i'm going to have to let one of you go	
me, me, let it be me	
leonard, you are my roommate,	
my source of transportation,	
and you help me fold my sheets	
when they come out of the dryer	
you are safe	
can i whistle	
don't be silly	
you do not have a phd	
your cologne is an assault on the senses	
and you're not available for video games	
during the jewish high holidays	
guilty as charged i'm out	
you too are safe	
come on what do i have to do	
okay, you know what	
i see where this is going	
i'm not one of you guys	
i'm not a scientist, so just tell me	
everything you're saying is true,	
but please allow me to continue	
you're out	
that's a good question	
while you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group,	
your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing	
how could you for a moment think my favorite amino acid is glutamine	
he had lysine, but changed it	
shoulda, woulda, coulda, raj	
i like to floss before i eat	
so my gum pockets are open	
for new food	
how did i walk past you	
i'm barry	
that's not a very hot name	
i'm going to call you roxanne	
pot stickers	
suddenly, i'm looking pretty good, huh	
so, kripke, i was wondering	
if there's any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer	
but we're friends	
i'm sorry	
no, my friend	
i'm confused	
i was given to understand that you allow your friends time on the machine	
no, that's wrong	
there's an official schedule	
i have no control over it	
this entire endeavor seems to have been an exercise in futility	
raj, you're back in	
he likes monkeys	
you've got to give him credit for sticking with it	
i didn't think he had it in him	
and he almost made it to the top this time
