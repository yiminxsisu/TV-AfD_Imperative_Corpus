So you see, what you're eating is not technically yogurt,because it doesn't have enough live acidophilus cultures
It's really just ice milk with carrageenan added for thickness
That's very interesting
It's also not pink and has no berries
Yeah, but it doesn't really answer my question
What was your question again
Do you want some
Right
No
I'm lactose intolerant
Right
So, gas
Yeah, got it
Well, good night
What are you doing
There's a draft
I didn't feel a draft
Why don't we just go into, your
Yeah, you know what, maybe we should slow things down a little
I didn't mean to  go into your apartment to go fast
No, I know
I know what you meant, it's just this is only our first date
Okay, sure, no problem
Why don't we just figure out where we're going and when we want to get there, and then rate of speed equals distance over time, solve for R
Or we could just wing it
That might work, too
Good night, Leonard
Good night
He's coming
Screensaver
Hey, Leonard
How was your date
Bite me
Sheldon, how could you just sit there and let them spy on me
They were clever
They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing
You should thank us
When future generations try to determine why your relationship with Penny crashed and burned,this right here is the black box
What are you talking about
The date went fine
She said she wantsto slow things down
Okay, so she said she wants to slow things down
It's like saying, I'm really enjoying this meal
I'm going to slow down and savor it
No, it's like, This fish tastes bad, "so I'm gonna slow down and spit it out
"You being the fish
I'm not the fish
Really
Did you make a second date
No, we sort of decided to wing it
Even I know that's lame
Okay, all right,let's assume your hypothesis
We went to dinner, we talked, we laughed, we kissed
Where could I have possibly gone wrong
Think back, Leonard
The littlest things can set women off
Like, Hey, the waitress is hot, I bet we could get her to come home with us
Or, How much does your mom weigh
I want to know what I'm getting into
I didn't say anything like that
Good, 'cause they don't work
They also don't care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate
Sadly, that's my home run swing
Look, everything went fine
I didn't even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters
That woman across the hall is into me
Let's go to the tape
Look at her reaction to the good night kiss
No change in respiration, pupils un-dilated, no flushing of the chest
Nice close-up, by the way
Interesting
Her jaws are clenched:no tongue access
Clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans
That's not a bad sign
Please, you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement
And the worst sign of all is you're here and not there
I'm not there because I'm taking things slow, which, by the way, compared to you guys, approaches warp speed
And take down that camera
He was a lot more fun when he had no hope
Give him time
Hi
Oh, hi, Penny
FYI, the hot water is inadequate on machine two, so colors only, and four is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle, so avoid using it for your delicates
Thanks
Good Lord
why don't you just take your clothesdown to the river and beat them with a rock
Can I ask you a question
I would prefer that you not, but I won't go so far as to forbid it
All right, I heard yes, so
Here's my question
Has Leonard ever dated, you know, a regular girl
I assume you're not referring to digestive regularity
Because I've come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate
No, I meant, has he ever been involved with someone who wasn't a brainiac
A few years ago, he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French literature
How is that not a brainiac
Well, for one thing, she was French
For another, it was literature
So
Do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating, he'll eventually get bored with me
That depends
On what
Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics
Do you speak Klingon
You know any card tricks
Okay, you know what
I get it
Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress-slash-actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college
Why would you lie about that
He was going on and on about this college and that grad school,I didn't want him to think I was some kind of stupid loser
You thought the opposite of "stupid loser" was "community college graduate"
You know, there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates
Yeah, but you are neither
Right
Okay, this is between you and me
You cannot tell Leonard any of this
You're asking me to keep a secret
Well, I'm sorry,but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret, so I could've chosen if I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping
You can't impose a secret on an ex post facto basis
What
Secret keeping is a complicated endeavor
One has to be concerned not only about what one says, but about facial expressions, autonomic reflexes
When I try to deceive, I myself have more nervous tics than a Lyme disease research facility
It's a joke
It relies on the homonymic relationship between "tick," the bloodsucking arachnid, and "tic," the involuntary muscular contraction
I made it up myself
Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied,I will absolutely die of embarrassment
Physiologically impossible
Sheldon, please
Look, I am asking you as a friend
So you're saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences
Yeah
Interesting
One more question, and perhaps I should have led with this
When did we become friends
ie, I couldn't become Green Lantern unless I was chosen by the Guardians of Oa, but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility, I could be Batman
You could be Batman
Sure
I'm Batman
See
Hi, guys
Hi, Penny
If you're free Friday night, I thought maybe we could go see a movie
Oh, you know, I think I have the dinner shift on Friday
What about Saturday
I'm not sure; the manager hasn't posted the schedule yet
How about I let you know
Great
So you just let me know when you know
Okay, so
Oh, God, I am the bad fish
What did I do wrong
Why are you asking me
I have no information about your interactions with Penny other than what you have provided me, nor do I have any method of learning such things
What does that mean
Nothing
You seem to be implying an informational back-channel between me and Penny where obviously none exists
No, I didn't
I just think you need to be careful how you phrase things, sir
What's going on with you
I might ask you the same question
Why are you attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me, but exist between you and Penny, a person to whom I barely speak
What's wrong with your face
There's no reason to bring my looks into this
Good day, Leonard
What
I said, Good dayGood day
Also today, we have a fresh-caught Alaska salmon, and that's served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice
Our soup of the day is
You must release me from my oath
Sheldon, I'm working
Why don't you take a minute to decide
Oh, my
I can't keep your secret
I'm going to fold like an energy-based de novo protein in conformational space
Like a Renaissance tryptich
Like a cheap suit
Look, why is it so hard for youto keep one little secret
I'm constitutionally incapable
That's why I was refused clearance for a prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider located beneath a fake agricultural station 12 and half miles southeast of Traverse City, Michigan
Which you did not hear about from me
Just forget I told you about me not graduating from community college
Forget
You want me to forget
This mind does not forget
I haven't forgotten a single thing since my mother stopped breastfeeding me
It was a drizzly Tuesday
Okay
You promised me you would keep my secret, so just figure out a way to do it
Leonard, I'm moving out
What do you mean, you're moving out
Why
There doesn't have to be a reason
Yeah, there kinda does
Not necessarily
This is a classic example of Munchausen's Trilemma
Either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression, or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements, or it's ultimately circular, ie I'm moving out because I'm moving out
I'm still confused
Leonard, I don't see how I could have made it any simpler
Hey, qu'est-ce que s'up
We just got back from that exhibit of those plasticized human cadavers
And some of those skinless chicks were hot
If you'll excuse me, I'm going to pack
That's kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia
It's not you, Howard
He says he's moving out
What did you do
Did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the TV
Did you take a Band-Aid off in front of him
Did you buy generic ketchup, forget to rinse the sink, talk to him through the bathroom door
Adjust the thermostat, cook with cilantro, pronounce the "t" in often
Did you make fun of trains
No, I didn't do anything
He's just gone insane
We all knew this day was coming
That was fast
It's my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag
It's recommended by the Department of Homeland Security
And Sarah Connor
Where are you going to live
Until I find a permanent place, I will stay with friends
Bye
You can't stay with me
I have a teeny-tiny apartment
Excuse me, but isn't hosting guests an aspect of manushya yajna, one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the Hindu householder
I hate trains
Don't be ridiculous,you love trains
Yes, I do
Come on
See you later, Leonard
This could work
This is a very old building
60 years
It used to be a watch factory
What
Don't you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials
Not until now
I can't believe I didn't bringmy Geiger counter
I had it on my bed and I didn't pack it
If you're not comfortable staying
I'm kidding, I packed it
It was a joke
I was subverting the conversational expectations
I believe they call that the ol' switcheroo
Terrific
Is that woman Aishwarya Rai
Yes, isn't she an amazing actress
Actually, I'd say she's a poor man's Madhuri Dixit
How dare you
Aishwarya Rai is a goddess
By comparison, Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute
Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you
Obviously, you're not that familiar with Indian cinema
Who is it
Strip-o-Gram
Tag, you're it
Shouldn't you put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire
I've never slepton an air mattress before
No lumbar support whatsoever
Maybe you'd be happier on a park bench
I don't see any way to get a park bench in here
Do you want to switch
No, that's fine
I'm perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle
Get out of bed
We're switching
Only if you want to
Just get in the bed
What's going on
Are you boys roughhousing
We're just talking, Ma
If you don't settle down right now,I'm not going to let you have any more sleepovers
For God's sake, Ma,I'm 27 years old
And it's not even a school night
Comfy now
That poster of Halle Berry is a little unnerving
So don't look at it
She's like my fourth favorite Catwoman
No kidding
Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer,Eartha Kitt, and then her
What about Lee Merriweather
I forgot about Lee Merriweather
I'm glad that's settled
That makes Halle Berry my fifth favorite Catwoman
It's Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer,Eartha Kitt, Lee Merriweather
Please, I'm begging you
Go to sleep
I'm trying
I'm counting Catwomen
She did make a fine mutant in the X-Men movies, though
For God's sake
She's not my favorite of the X-Men
In order that would be:Wolverine, Cyclops
I forgot Professor X
Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops,Iceman, then Storm,Angel, the Beast--No, wait, Nightcrawler, Professor X, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, Storm, Angel
I'm coming
There he is
There my old buddy bud bud
What's with him
Koothrappali dumped him on me, and he couldn't get to sleep, so I gave him a glass of warm milk with a handful of my mom's Valium in it, but he still wouldn't shut up, so tag, you're it
I'm ba-ack
I still don't know why you left
I can't tell you
Why not
I promised Penny
You promised Penny what
I wouldn't tell you the secret
What secret
Tell me the secret
Mom smokes in the car
Jesus is okay with it but we can't tell Dad
Not that secret
The other secret
I'm Batman
Damn it
Sheldon
You said Penny told you a secret
What's the secret
Okay, I'll tell you, but you can't tell Leonard
I promise
Penny lied about graduating from community college cause she's afraid she's not smart enough for Leonard
So it's nothing I did
It's her problem
I drank milk that tasted funny
Penny thinks I'm too smart for her
That's ridiculous
I know
Most of your workis extremely derivative
And don't worry, that's not a secret
Everybody knows
Hi
Yeah, hi
I know what's been bothering you about us, and I have the answer
What are you talking about
First, I wanna say that it's not Sheldon's fault
He tried very hard to keep your secret
If Howard hadn't drugged him, he would've taken it to his grave
He told you
Yes, but it's okay
Now that we know what the problem is there's a simple solution
Pasadena City College
A place for fun, a place for knowledgeThis man here is playing hackey-sack, and this girl's gonna be a paralegal
Oh, I get it
Because Dr Leonard Hofstadter can't date a girl without a fancy college degree
It's really not that fancy
It's just a city college
Right, but I have to have some sort of degree to date you
That doesn't matter to me at all
So it's fine with you if I'm not smart
Absolutely
Okay, this time, I know where I went wrong
Bite me
