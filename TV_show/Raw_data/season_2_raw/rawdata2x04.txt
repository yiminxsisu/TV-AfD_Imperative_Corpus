let's see,	
raj was the kung paoâ€“chicken	
i'm the dumplings	
yes, you are	
creepy, howard	
creepy good or creepy bad	
who was the shrimp with lobster sauce	
that would be me	
come to papa, you unkosher delight	
i'm not necessarily	talking to the food	
sit over there	
sit over there	
baby wipe	
why do you have	
no, don't ask don't	
i'll tell you why	
i had to sanitize my hands the university replaced the paper towels	in the rest rooms with hot air blowers	
i thought the blowers were more sanitary	
really, don't	
why	
hot air blowers	are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence	
frankly, it'd be more hygienic if they had a plagueinfested gibbon	
sneeze my hands dry	
hey, guys, i just got	
the most amazing news	
do you think you'll ever be able to talk in front of me without being drunk	
okay, i'll just, go eat by myself	
you don't have to do that	
it's okay, between him not talking, him talking and him	I'm better off alone	
goodbye, you poor, strange little man	
she's so considerate	
what's your news	
remember that little planetary object i spotted beyond the kuiper belt	
oh, yeah, nq sub	
or as i call it, planet bollywood	
anyway, because of my discovery,	
people magazine is naming me	
one of their  under  to watch	
congratulations	
that's incredible	
excuse me, what under  what to watch what visionaries under  years of age to watch as they challenge the preconceptions of their fields	
if i had a million guesses,	i never would have gotten that	
they've got me in with a guy who's doing something about hunger in indonesia, and a psychotherapist who's using	dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners, and ellen page,	star of the charming independent film, juno	
i'd so do her	
you'd do the dolphins	
do i get an honorable	
mention for designing	
the telescope camera	
mounting bracket you used	
sorry, it's not part of my heartwarming and personal narrative in which a humble boy from new delhi overcame poverty and prejudice and journeyed to america	to reach for the stars	
poverty	
your father's a gynecologist	
he drives a bentley	
it's a lease	
i'm confused	
was there some sort of peer review committee to determine which scientists would be included	
peer review	
it's people magazine	
people picked me	
what people	
the people from people	
but exactly who are these people	
what are their credentials	
how are they qualified	
what makes accidentally	
noticing a hunk of rock	
that's been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years	
more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under	
boy, i'll bet ellen page's friends	
aren't giving her this kind of crap	
are you proud of yourself	
in general, yes	
there's my missing neutrino	
you were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge, weren't you, you little subatomic dickens	
hey, look,	
i found my missing neutrino	
oh good, we can take it	off the milk carton	
we're going to apologize to raj	and invite him out to dinner	
apologize for what	
he came over last night	ith some pretty good news	
and we weren't very supportive	
i sense you're trying to tell me something	
you were a colossal asshat	
no, i beg to differ	of the three of us, i was by far the most supportive	
really do tell	
how will raj ever reach true greatness	
if his friends lower the bar for him	
when i was ,	
my sister bought our father	a "world's greatest dad" coffee mug	
and, frankly, the man coasted until the day he died	
okay, let's try it this way	
what if this people magazine thing is the best he's ever gonna achieve	
i had not considered that	
come on	
i often forget	
other people have limitations	
it's so sad	
he can feel sadness	
not really	
it's what you and i	would call condescension	
now when we go in there,	
let's show raj that we're happy for him    
but i'm not	   
well, then fake it	   
look at me	
i could be grinding on the fact	
that without my stabilizing	
telescope mount	
he never would have found that stupid,	
little clump of cosmic schmutz	
but i'm bigger than that	
fine	
what do you want me to do	
smile	
crap, that's terrifying	
we're here to see koothrappali, not kill batman	
try less teeth	
close enough	
come on	
hey, raj	
hey, guys what's up	
we just wanted to invite you out to dinner	
to celebrate your	
" under " thing	
right, sheldon	
that's very nice of you	
i would like that	
hello, boys	
dr gablehauser	
dr koothrappali	
dr gablehauser	
dr hofstader	
dr gablehauser	
dr cooper	
dr gablehauser	
mr wolowitz	
boys, i've got a question for you	
who in this room	
discovered a star	
actually, nq sub	
is a planetary body	
i'm not talking about you,	
i'm talking about me	
you, my exotic young friend,	
are my star	
but you didn't discover him	
you merely noticed he was here,	
much like he did	
with nq sub	
sorry	
boy, we've got to get you into a better office	
something more suited	
to your status	
you don't have to go to any trouble	
how about von gerlich's old office	
i'd rather have fishbein's	
it's bigger	
wait a minute,	
i called dibs on fishbein's office	
the day he started showing up	
at work in his bathrobe	
he gets a new office, i can't even get	
paper towels in the men's room	
damn, this is hard	
let me ask you something	
what do you think	
the business of this place is	
science	
money	
told you	
and this boy's picture in people magazine is gonna raise us a pile of money taller than	
well, taller than you	
i have a master's degree	
who doesn't	
have you ever had lunch	in the president's dining room	
i didn't even know there was a president's dining room	
it's the same food as the cafeteria, only fresh	
come on, little buddy	
okay, big buddy	
see you tonight, guys	
you can stop smiling now	
so anyway, after a fantastic lunch,	
i was whisked off to the people magazine photo shoot	
have any of you boys ever been to a photo shoot	
it's fantastic	
apparently,	
the camera loves me and i, it	
they shot me in front of a starry background where i posed like this	
they're going to digitally add	
a supernova	
they say it's the perfect metaphor	
for my incandescent talent	
right, a ball of hot, flaming gas	
that collapses upon itself	
excuse me	
oh, it's my assistant, trevor	
go for koothrappali	
they gave him an assistant	
if i want a new pen, i have to go to the bank with wire cutters	
have we at this point	
met our social obligations	
not yet	
okay, just put it on my calendar,	
but start thinking of a reason	
why i can't go	
all righty	
koothrappali out	
god bless that boy	
i don't know what i'd do without him	
you just got him this afternoon	
yes, but i'm finding	
that having a lackey suits me	
a lackey	
i'm sorry	
is that politically incorrect	
in india, we just call them	
untouchables	
now	
almost	
speaking of untouchables,	
i've got great news for you guys	
people magazine is having a reception this saturday and i managed to get you invited	
gee, thanks	
you're welcome	
of course, i couldn't get you	
into the vip section	
because, you know, that's for vips	
and you guys are just,	
you know p's	
there's a tribe in papua new guinea	
where, when a hunter	
flaunts his success	
to the rest of the village,	
they kill him	
and drive away evil spirits	
with a drum made of his skin	
superstious nonsense, of course, but one can see their point	
here you go, raj	
you might want to drink this one slowly	
so, saturday night,	
can i count on my posse	
gee, i'd love to, raj,	
but i can't make it	
no, i could	
i can make it but i won't	
what are you talking about	
there's a reception	
for my magazine article on saturday	
and you guys aren't going	
i can't believe you raj is celebrating	
a tremendous accomplishment	
and you're not even going to support him	
a tremendous accomplishment would be	
if the planetary body he discovered	
were plummeting toward earth	
and he exploded it with his mind	
that would be cool	
i'd go to that reception	
come on, this is huge	
raj is gonna be in people magazine,	
and he didn't even have to knock up	
one of the spears sisters	
would you like to go with me	
of course i would	
i would be honored	
really cool	
shame on you guys	
look at that,	
i got a date with penny	
i can't believe	
it took you a whole year	
now	
now	
hey, buddy,	
i'm going to be	
in people magazine	
yeah, call me	
when you're on the cover	
raj, look at you	
i know i'm resplendent	
like the noonday sun, am i not	
yeah starting with the champagne	
a little early, aren't you	
it was in the limo	
they sent a limo	
i have a limo	
i just love saying "limo"	
sip on it while you're getting ready	
i'm ready	
that's what you're wearing	
why, what's wrong with it	
nothing i was just hoping	
for something a little more, you know,	
ridonkulous	
yeah well, this is all the donkulous	
you're gonna get tonight	
okeydokey, let's roll	
all right, it's time to raise the roof	
hey, leonard	
dude	
you look very nice	
thank you	
come on good night	
good night	
hey, leonard, do you	
see my limo downstairs	
it's bigger than the house	
my grandfather grew up in	
terrific	
it has more food, too	
come on come on	
good news you don't have to sulk	
about penny anymore	
there are hundreds of croatian women	
just waiting for you to contact them	
anythingforagreencardcom	
i'll lend you my user name	
it's "wealthy big penis"	
you're joking	
you gotta make it easy for 'em	
they're just learning english	
pass	
so you're just gonna	
sit around here and mope	
while penny is out with dr apu	
from the kwike mart	
it's not a date,	
and that's racist	
it can't be racist	
he's a beloved character	
on the simpsons	
let's just eat	
so i can get to bed	
with any luck, tonight will be the night my sleep apnea kills me	
did you ask for the chicken	
with broccoli to be diced, not shredded	
even though the menu description	
specifies "shredded"	
brown rice, not white	
did you stop at the korean grocery	
and get the good hot mustard	
did you pick up the low sodium	
soy sauce from the market	
thank you	
you're welcome	
what took you so long	
just sit down and eat	
fine	
all right, it's shredded	
what do you want me to do	
i want you to check before you accept the order	
sorry	
were you distracted by the possibility	
that koothrappali	
might have intercourse	
with penny tonight	
he's not going to have	
intercourse with penny	
then there's no excuse	
for this chicken	
you know, this situation	
with koothrappali	
brings to mind	
a story from my childhood	
oh, goody, more tales	
from the panhandle	
that's northwest texas	
i'm from east texas,	
the gulf region,	
home to many vietnamese shrimpers	
do the shrimpers feature	
in your story	
anyway,	
when i was eight,	
a montgomery ward delivery van	
ran over our family cat lucky	
lucky	
yes, lucky	
he's ironyimpaired	
just move on	
dead cat named lucky	
continue	
while others mourned lucky,	
i realized his untimely demise	
provided me with the opportunity to replace him	with something more suited to my pet needs	
a faithful companion	
that i could snuggle with at night,	
yet would be capable of killing	
upon telepathic command	
so not a puppy	
please, nothing so pedestrian	
i wanted a griffin	
a griffin	
yes, half eagle, half lion	
and mythological	
irrelevant	
i was studying	
recombinant dna technology,	
and i was confidant i could create one,	
but my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary	
eagle eggs and lion semen	
of course, my sister got swimming	
lessons when she wanted them	
not that we don't all enjoy	
a good lion semen story,	
but what's your point	
my point is	
if koothrappali is moving on to a new life	
of shallow undeserved fame,	
perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort	
you want to breed a new friend	
that's one option,	
but who has the time	
but consider this	
the japanese are doing	
some wonderful work	
with artificial intelligence	
now, you combine that	
with some animatronics	
from the imagineers over at disney,	
next thing you know,	
we're playing halo	
with a multilingual abraham lincoln	
don't take this the wrong way,	
but you're insane	
that may well be, but the fact is	
it wouldn't kill us to meet some new people	
for the record, it could kill us to meet new people	
they could be murderers	
or the carriers of unusual pathogens	
and i'm not insane	
my mother had me tested	
if we do get a new friend,	
he should be a guy you can trust	
a guy who has your back	
and he should have a lot of money	
and live in a cool place by the beach	
where we could throw parties	
and share our love of technology	
and he should know a lot of women	
let's see, money,	
women, technology	
okay, we're agreed	
our new friend is going to be iron man	
welcome to the raj mahal	
it's very nice	
good night	
wait the evening's not over	
yes, it is	
no, it's time to put on some r kelly and suck face	
is the evening over	
wait, wait, wait	
that's my mommy and daddy	
calling from india	
i want you to meet my parents	
wait meet them	
hello, mommy, daddy	
good to see you	
how are you	
i'm not drunk	
why would you say that	
just making conversation	
mommy, daddy, i want you to meet my new squeeze, penny	
i'm not your squeeze	
there is no squeezing	
i can't see her	
center her in the frame	
here you go cute, huh	
she's not indian	
so she's not indian	
the boy is just sowing some wild oats	
there's no sowing, no squeezing	and no sucking face	
what if he gets her pregnant	
is this little hotsytotsy who you want	
as the mother of your grandchildren	
what right do you have to pick	
with whom i can have children with	
look, rajesh, i understand,	
you're in america	
you want to try	
the "local cuisine"	
trust me	
you don't want it for a steady diet	
now you listen to me	
i am no longer a child	
and i will not be	
spoken to like one	
now if you'll excuse me,	
i have to go throw up	
what's wrong with him	
i don't know	
maybe it's the local cuisine	
well, it's nice to meet you	
i'm just gonna set you on down over here	
and i'm gonna leave, so	
namaste	
and fyi, you'd be lucky to have me as a daughterinlaw	
she's feisty	
i like that	
raj, what are you doing	
no notes if you have	
something to say to me, say it	
sorry	
sweetie, it's okay
