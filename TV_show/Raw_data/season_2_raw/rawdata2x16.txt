that was close	
god, i love the smell of paintballs in the morning	
yeah, still funny	
we can't get to the ridge	
the chemistry department has us completely cut off	
and the creek bed he pharmacology department controls that,	
and they're all hopped up on experimental steroids	
that's it then	
we're doomed	
the time has come to acknowledge	
that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my physics department paintball strategy meeting	
i told you my mom has spider veins	
i had to take her to the laser clinic	
and i told you i wanted	to see a doctor's note	
we need a plan	
how about operation hammer of the gods	
which one is hammer of the gods	
we hide behind the dumpsters in the parking lot and ambush people when they come to pee	
no go the dumpsters are deep	
in astronomy department territory hat shouldn't be a problem	
venus is up during the day	
they're probably just all staring at the sky	
what we need now is a tactical retreat	
did you see the episode of stargate	
where they found themselves on a planet with a culture based loosely on earth's athens and sparta	
not important	
leonard, raj and i are going to burst out the door and run away	
howard will cover us	
why don't i run away	
and you cover me	
because you chose your mother's veins over victory	
on three	
one, two, three, go	
i had to take her	
it's almost bathing suit weather	
i surrender don't shoot	
they went that way	
howard, i'm on your team	
leslie, thank god	
where's the rest of your squad	
they left me here to die	
what about yours	
dead, all of them	
sorry	
don't be	
it was friendly fire	
they just wouldn't listen	
well, we're surrounded,	
so i guess there's nothing for us to do	
but wait to be captured or killed	
that's the worst part, the waiting	
all the while knowing that there's a paint pellet out there with your name on it	
the big wet ball of death kind of makes you feel more alive, doesn't it	
it kind of does	
i say we make every moment count	
i agree	
how exactly do we do that	
why aren't you covering us	
we're getting slaughtered out here	
war is hell	
did you guys see the budget nemo hat went out this morning	
more cutbacks	
unacceptable	
it baffles me	
why they don't simply let some of you go	
so that there's money available for my research	
you know what baffles me based on your academic record,	
any number of things, i imagine	
hey, guys	
hey	
i got the approval for the rapid prototyper you wanted	
that's great, leslie thanks	
you scratch my back,	
i scratch yours	
what was all that about	
no big deal	
they gave leslie control of some unrestricted grant money	
yeah, okay, but what's with the backscratching and the meow	
i believe the backscratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation	
where one party provides goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action	
thank you	
the meow, that sounded to me like an african civet cat	
are you done	
despite what the name suggests, the civet cat is not a true cat	
now i'm done	
you know what i'm thinking	
i'm thinking howard wasn't making a backscratching metaphor	
i'm thinking there was some actual scratching involved	
what about it	
i didn't want to say anything	
'cause i know you and leslie have a little history	
i don't care about that	
great, i've been dying to say something	
you and leslie n the paintball shed twice	
is that why you didn't cover our escape and let us get cut down like animals	
oh, yeah, sorry about that	
my good man, dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy is a courtmartial offense	
courtmartial, schmortmartial,	
leslie winkle is the fifth girl 	i mean, for free	
plus, you got a rapid prototyper	
that's an expensive piece of equipment	
and the rest of us have had our budgets cut to the bone	
one way to look at this	
is that i'm getting new equipment,	
and you're not,	
and that's unfair	
but a better way to look at this is that i'm getting sex and you're not,	
and that's delightful	
the whole thing froze	
i don't know what happened	
calm down we'll figure it out	
how can i calm down	
i'm gonna lose my whole shopping cart	
that's three hours of picking out shoes	
just shot to hell	
hello, penny	
hello, sheldon	
you're in my spot	
are you planning on sitting here	
no, i'm going to the comic book store	
then what difference does it make	
what difference does it make	
here we go	
that is my spot	
in an everchanging world, it is a single point of consistency	
if my life were expressed as a function on a fourdimensional cartesian coordinate system,	
that spot at the moment	
i first sat on it	
would be zerozerozerozero	
what	
don't sit in his spot	
fine	
happy	
i'm not unhappy	
boy, i love him, but he is one serious wackadoodle	
okay, that should do it	
thank you you are a lifesaver	
that's a lot of shoes you ordered	
yeah, you know the sad thing is,	
it's really not	
is this one of those paintball guns	
you ought to come out with us sometime	
no, thanks i'm from nebraska	
when we shoot things,	
it's because we want to eat them or make them leave	
our boyfriends alone	
boy, your heart's racing	
i must've really gotten you going	
well, it's partly you,	
partly my transient idiopathic arrhythmia	
sexy	
can i assume that you've likewise found the experience satisfactory	
that wasn't quite the word i was looking for,	
but sure, i'll do this passfail	
are you enjoying that prototyper i got you	
it's great	
everybody in the engineering department is eating their hearts out	
isn't it nice when your good fortune makes others miserable	
you know, most people don't get that	
howard, i'm home	
oh, great	
book club was cancelled	
that thing on phyllis's neck opened up again	
i'm busy, ma	
too busy to help your mother with her zipper	
don't come in, ma	
why not	
he's got company	
there's the arrhythmia	
is she jewish	
are you jewish	
no	
yes	
okay, then you kids have fun	
use protection	
you think he'll notice	
there's a chance	
what are we gonna do	
"we"	
no, you had your chance to be "we" for, like, a year and a half now	
right now, you are "you," and you are screwed	
why do we have to tell him i did it	
we're not gonna tell him i did it	
okay, okay, how about this	
we tell him somebody broke in	
just to shoot the couch with a paintball gun	
i'm sorry, i buy it	
all those people are on drugs	
we could tell him they wanted the couch	
to stay away from their boyfriend	
okay, fine	
what if we just flip it over	
there looks fine, right	
butt print	
there's no discernible butt print	
oh, come on	
there, butt print	
it's too small and too	
perfect	
thank you	
you're welcome	
act normal	
how was the comic book store	
fine the new issue of flash is out	
great, great	
did you walk the whole way	
it's a little chilly	
koothrappali picked me up	
isn't that terrific	
he is such a good friend	
you know what the best thing about friends is	
they don't talk incessantly for no particular reason	
no, friends forgive the little things	
i gotta go home and wash my hair	
don't you dare, missy	
hello, fastest man alive want to see me read your entire comic book	
want to see it again	
something's wrong	
what do you mean	
i'm not sure	
it doesn't feel right	
i don't know	
what you're talking about	
oh, that penny did that	
excuse me	
why don't you just eat in your desk chair	
why don't i just eat in my desk chair	
here we go	
that is my desk chair	
that is where i work	
i don't eat in my desk chair	
and i don't work in my spot	
i work in my desk chair	
and eat in my spot	
wackadoodle	
you know, there's kind of an obvious solution here	
get up	
there problem solved	
nobody cares where you're going to sit	
you're not crazy	
excuse me,	
but the problem is not solved	
if your head had been accidentally amputated,	
and we transplanted a dog's head in its place, would that be "problem solved"	
if it were your head, it would be	
i am really, really sorry,	
but it's only for a week	
can't you be a little bit flexible	
yeah, sorry	
i didn't really think that through	
you claimed it's going to be a week,	
but i have no faith in your dry cleaner	
why not	
did you notice the sign on his counter	
he's not a fulltime dry cleaner	
he also makes keys for god's sake, sheldon	
focus is important	
was michael debakey a wedding planner	
in between heart transplants	
did alexander fleming moonlight	
as a hairdresser	
"thanks for discovering penicillin	
now how about we try a bouffant"	
looks like i'm gonna have sex tonight	
hey, baby	
his right hand is calling him	
no, it's leslie winkle	
it's a long story	
i'll pick you up in ten minutes	
gentlemen, adieu	
i thought we were going	to play halo tonight	
what am i supposed to do	
there's a woman out there anxious to have sex with me	
you understand, right	
no not at all	
nevertheless, i must depart	
by the way, did i tell you leslie pulled some strings and got me on the research trip to geneva to check out the cern supercollider	
that's not fair	
you're not even a physicist	
there are two ways of looking at this	
get out	
bye	
you're improving	
thank you	
it helps when i get to practice	
with a real woman	
listen	
saturday my sister's getting married	
i want you to come with me	
it's black tie	
yeah, gee	
i'd really rather not	
why not	
when i go to weddings,	
it's to scam on chunky bridesmaids	
i don't know what i would do with a date	
all right i understand	
thanks	
i'm really sorry about that geneva trip	
what about it	
didn't you hear i reduced the number of people going,	
and you didn't make the cut	
when did that happen	
about  seconds ago	
well, hold on	
are you saying if i don't go to the wedding, i can't go to geneva	
actually, i'm trying not to say it	
okay, i'm sorry,	
but that makes me a little uncomfortable	
how so	
'cause it's like you're controlling me with new equipment and research trips	
if i weren't controlling you with new equipment and research trips, then i'd be uncomfortable	
how so	
'cause we'd be in a real relationship with feelings and all that crap	
so, bottom line, i'm just a boughtandpaidfor sex toy	
no, not at all	
you're also arm candy	
so	
what do you think	
hey, ma, you got to rent me a tux	
right now	
what kind of sex are you having up there	
why are you crouching there	
this is my spot	
where else am i supposed to crouch	
i don't know texas	
here you go fresh from the cleaners,	
good as new	
really great	
sheldon, look good as new from that key maker,	
i highly doubt it	
come on, sheldon	
just give it a try	
all right	
there, nice and comfy cozy	
zero, zero, zero	
there's one more zero	
you forgot the time parameter	
sit on the damn couch	
what do you mean, "nope"	
what's wrong with it	
nothing, it's what's wrong with him	
it's exactly the same	
penny, i think i know what to do	
sheldon, i have some bad news	
more	
i'm afraid so	
you know the cashew chicken i get you monday nights	
yes from szechuan palace	
szechuan palace closed two years ago	
what	
where did my cashew chicken come from	
golden dragon	
no, this isn't right	
our food always comes in szechuan palace containers	
yeah, well,	
before they went out of business,	
i bought , containers	
i keep them in the trunk of my car	
but this changes everything	
i thought that might take his mind off the cushion	
what's real what isn't	
how can i know	
you did make that up, right	
oh, god, i wish i had	
leonard	
yeah, buddy	
i still don't like this cushion	
okay, first of all,	
penny, thank you for coming	
thanks for the shoes	
penny is an amazing shot	
we have a real chance to win this week	
what's the plan	
now, we all run out	
sheldon and i will cut	to the left behind these trees	
raj, howard and leslie flank to the right behind the rocks	
we'll have a great view as penny runs out and kills everyone else in sight	
just one thing before we start	
what is it, sheldon	
what the hell	
that was for my cushion	
sheldon, penny was our only hope	
i'm sorry	
but revenge is a dish best served cold	
screw that	
she can't shoot me	
she's dead	
he's right you can't	
well, if we're going to descend into anarchy	
see you	
where are you going	
surrender, then denny's
