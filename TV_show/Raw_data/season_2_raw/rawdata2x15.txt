fellas, please	
penny, come on	
we were just finding our sound	
you found it	
it's the sound of a cat being run over by a lawn mower	
i'm really very busy	
is there any way hat we can put this off	
until i have more time to prepare	
of course	
but, you understand my trepidation	
what's that about	
not a clue	
can't we just postpone it till the spring	
maybe next summer	
this should be fairly easy to deduce	
he's holding the phone to his left ear	
ears do not cross hemispheres,	
so he's using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain,	
suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller	
no, i didn't realize	
it had been so long	
sure, i guess there's no other choice but to just go ahead and do it	
he's referring to an activity	
he has done before	
it's unpleasant and needs to be repeated	
this suggests some sort of invasive medical test,	
like perhaps a colonoscopy	
aren't there any other options	
there's not a lot of room	
it's gonna be uncomfortable	
yes, yes	
i'm definitely going with colonoscopy	
okay, bye	
my mother's coming to visit	
how about that, you were right	
it's out of order	
yes, i can read the sign	
i'm just pondering the implications	
i think it implies that the elevator doesn't work	
again, i can read the sign but the sign and the tape are covered with a layer of dust,	
which indicates that the elevator has been nonfunctional for a significant amount of time	
which suggests either a remarkable passivity among the, i assume, to  residents of this building, based on the number of mailboxes and given typical urban population density or a shared delusion of functionality	
you must be leonard's mother	
i don't know if i must be, but yes	
i'm penny	
i'm his neighbor	
dr beverly hofstadter	
nice to meet you	
you're a hand shaker	
interesting	
come with me	
i'll walk you to the apartment	
would you like to exchange pleasantries on the way	
yeah, sure, i guess	
all right, you start	
i've always been curious what was leonard like when he was little	
i think you mean young	
he's always been little	
right	
what was he like when he was young	
you'll have to be more specific	
okay, like, five or six	
five	
at that age, he was well enmeshed n what freud would call the phallic stage of psychosexual development	
an outmoded theory, of course,	
but the boy did spend most of his waking hours with a tight grasp on his penis	
leonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist	
that is one of my degrees	
my primary field is neuroscience	
well, i'm an actress	
why	
what do you mean why	
there are studies that suggest that many who go into he performing arts suffer from an external locus of identity	
yeah, i don't know what that means	
it means you value yourself only as others value you,	
which is often the result of unmet childhood emotional needs	
i had a wonderful childhood	
tell me about it	
i know my dad wanted a boy	
i tried being good at sports,	
but i hated getting dirty	
and then, i'm assuming, you entered adolescence he called me slugger until i got my first training bra	
and then he just stopped playing catch with me	
i wasn't slugger anymore	
your mother's here	
if you want to have intercourse with that girl,	
find out what kind of cologne her father wore	
good to see you, mother	
here's your tea, mother	
oolong	
loose, not bagged	
steeped three minutes	
twopercent milk	
warmed separately	
one teaspoon sugar	
raw sugar	
it's cold	
i'll start again	
i have the same problem with him	
my theory is that his lack of focus stems from an overdeveloped sex drive	
i don't know where he would've gotten that aside from a pro forma consummation of our marriage,	
his father and i only had intercourse for the purposes of reproduction	
that seems a fairly efficient arrangement	
yes, we think so	
we've both done papers on it	
mine from the neuroscientific point of view	 and his from an anthropological	
mine, of course, was the onlyne worth reading	
of course	
i would very much like to read about your sex life	
it's all online or you can order it from the princeton university press	
here's your tea, mother	
so, what are you guys talking about	
the frequency with which your parents had intercourse	
swell	
if you're lucky, maybe she'll show you the powerpoint presentation	
i'm sorry, it's on my other laptop	
so, mother	
what's new	
you'll have to be more specific	
all right	
what's new with you	
well, i've been having some fascinating menopausal symptoms recently	
maybe something less personal	
your uncle floyd died	
oh, my god	
what happened	
his heart stopped beating	
i have to urinate	
what a remarkable woman	
yeah, ii thought you guys might hit it off	
i envy you your childhood	
i hate to tell you,	
but the only warm memories i have of my childhood are of my uncle floyd	
you're clearly misremembering	
your mother is brilliant, analytical, insightful	
and i'm betting she never hit you with a bible	
because you wouldn't eat your brussels sprouts	
you don't give your mother enough credit	
she's warm, she's loving,	
she doesn't glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves	
while potty training	
you were lucky	
when i was a kid, if i wanted an eeg,	
i had to attach my own electrodes	
so, dr hofstadter, leonard rarely talks about his incredibly successful brother and sister	
please, don't go there	
i understand that,	
unlike leonard, they're at the top of their respective fields	
boy, you suck	
leonard's younger brother, michael,	 is a tenured law professor at harvard,	
and his sister just successfully grew a human pancreas in an adolescent gibbon	
so, she's close to curing diabetes	
why else would you grow a pancreas in a teenaged gibbon	
you must be very proud	
why	
they're not my accomplishments	
i have to urinate	
why are you doing this	
you know the rules	
you brought your mom to work	
you must suffer	
i had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you	
you're like the jar jar binks	
of the hofstadter family	
oh, mesa think	
yousa lookin' so so sad	
rather than mock me,	
my friends might realize that this is difficult and try to help me through it	
nope, i think mocking you is more fun	
next time, don't yousa bring mama to work okeeday	
that was fast	
the middle stall was occupied	
i'll have to try again later	
that's totally understandable	
in bladder voiding, as in real estate,	
it's location, location, location	
so, where were we	
howard lives with his mother	
and raj can't speak to women unless he's drunk go	
that's fascinating	
selective mutism is quite rare	
on the other hand, an adult jewish male living with his mother is so common	
it borders on sociological clich√©	
it's just temporary i pay rent	
he lives in the same room where his bassinet was	
both selective mutism and an inability to separate from one's mother can stem from a pathological ear of women	
it might explain why the two of you have created an ersatz homosexual marriage to satisfy your need for intimacy	
say what	
that's basically what i just said	
you brought your husband to work	
you know the rules	
meesa thinking yousa looking	
pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha	
leonard, it's  weren't you going to show me your laboratory at 
there's no hurry tell them more	about their secret love for each other	
but it's  you were going to show me your laboratory at	
her reasoning is unassailable	
it is	
fine let's go	
i think you'll find my work pretty interesting	
i'm attempting to replicate the dark matter signal	
found in sodium iodide crystals by the italians	
so, no original research	
what's the point of my seeing it	
i could just read the paper the italians wrote	
just for the record, we're not in an ersatz homosexual relationship	
then why didn't you say that to her	
why is it always my responsibility	
it's not always your responsibility	
i swear, this is the same thing you did at the comic book store last week	
i can't believe you're bringing that up	
i didn't bring it up you did	
we'll talk about this later	
you always say that,	
but you never do	
you went to the comic book store without me	
you got alcohol	
your mom still here	
come on in	
wait, she's not gonna come here	
looking for you, is she	
relax she took sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan	
oh, my god what happened	
nothing	
mother likes looking at brains and sheldon likes getting his brain scanned	
geez, what a fun couple	
she's only been here a day and a half	
and i'm seriously considering alcoholism	
as a new career path	
i talked to her for  minutes yesterday	
and i've been half bombed ever since	
you can't let her get into your head	
my head, what about yours	
it's too late for me	
my head is her summer house	
she was right	
the locus of my identity is totally exterior to me	
yeah, there she is hi, mom	
do you know where i was all morning auditioning with  other blondes for some stupid antidepressant commercial	
and for what	
so i'll finally get my daddy's approval	
did you get the part	
no, they said i was too perky	
you want to talk about not getting love from a parent	
you know what i used to do when i was little to have some sensation of human contact	
yeah, you grabbed your penis and wouldn't let go	
your mother told me	
of course she did	
that's not what i was gonna say	
when i was ten years old,	
i built a hugging machine	
a hugging machine	
i got a dressmaker's mannequin,	
i stuffed it with an electric blanket	
so it would be warm,	
and built two radiocontrolled arms	
that would hug me and pat my back	
that is so sad	
you know what the saddest part was	
my father used to borrow it	
your scan data will be very helpful to my research	
you have a remarkable brain	
i know	
although i've always hated how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures	
common complaint among men	
nothing's ever big enough	
except when they get a tumor	
then you never hear the end of it	
i'd love to see	a scan of your brain sometime	
i'll send you a link, but its physiology	
is fairly unimpressive	
i can't believe that	
your unwillingness to accept empirical evidence	
suggests an attempt at flattery	
my apologies	
i've been living with your son too long	
gotten into some bad habits	
understandable	
can i make you a cup of tea	
i doubt it,	
but if anyone has a chance,	
it's probably you	
i feel very comfortable around you	
i feel very comfortable around you, too	
it's surprising	
because i generally don't feel comfortable around well, anyone	
nor i	
what are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son	
is that a rhetorical point	
or would you like to do the math	
i'd like to do the math	
i'd like that, too	
now this time,	
you're gonna lick the salt off my neck	
do the shot	
and then bite the lime	
i'm sorry, i didn't hear	
anything after "lick"	
neck, shot, lime	
shot, lime	
right	
where's the lime	
we're sharing	
so, what do you think	
i'm very tempted	
i'm just not sure it's appropriate with my son's roommate	
normally, i'd feel the same way	
but based on everything i've observed about us,	
i can't help but speculate we'd be very good together	
true i've had a similar observation	
it's certainly something	
i could never do with my husband	
i was hesitant	
the first time i tried it,	
but i experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphins	
it's quite satisfying	
i see what you're doing	
you're appealing to the neuroscientific researcher in me	
you see right through me, don't you	
only when you're in a cat scanner	
this is actually gonna happen	
honey, shush, shush	
you shush, i'm happy	
i want to talk about it	
you know what my mother would say	
she would say	
because you weren't loved by your father	
and i was not loved by my mother,	
that having sex is our way of making up for the intimacy	
we didn't get as children	
why would you bring that up	
right now	
i don't know	
foreplay	
so you're saying	
you're not having sex with me,	
you're having sex with your mother	
i'm gonna go with "no"	
that is the sickest thing	
i've ever heard	
come on, you're trying to have sex with your father and i'm okay with that	
get out	
she said shush	
i should have shushed	
all right, mother	
have a nice flight	
that's not really in my control, is it	
good morning	
morning	
i was just coming over to talk to you	
you don't have to ever	
gotcha	
goodbye, mother	
goodbye	
so, slugger, shall we pick up where we left off last time	
i mean, my mom could've just said,	
"bob, get over it, she's a girl, move on"	
but she didn't not one word	
interesting	
would you be willing to fly to new jersey and discuss your relationship	with your parents during a brain scan	
would it help	
well, it would help me
