problem	
this is thai food	
here we go	
we don't have thai food on thursday	
we have pizza on thursday	
yes, but we all agreed that the third thursday of every month would be anything can happen thursday	
apparently the news didn't reach my digestive system,	
which, when startled, has it's own version of anything can happen thursday	
come on, the whole idea behind	
anything can happen thursday is to get out of this rut	
we've been in lately	
"rut"	
i think you mean "consistency"	
and if we're going to abandon that,	
then why even call it thursday	
let's call it "quonko day" and divide it into  hours of  minutes apiece, and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god ra	
i could go for some goat	
sheldon, we agreed	
we'd do something different tonight	
all right	
let's go to the comic book store	
we went there last night	
last night was wednesday	
wednesday is comic book night	
tonight, we'll be going on thursday,	
because it's anything can happen thursday	
way to think outside but pressed right up against the box	
so what are we going to do tonight	
if i may proffer a suggestion, in bars all across	
this great nation of ours,	
thursday night is ladies' night	
which means,	
as the evening progresses,	
we will get better looking	
courtesy of  cent margaritas	
and twoforone jello shots	
come on, howard, the odds of us picking up girls in a bar are practically zero	
really are you familiar with the drake equation	
the one that estimates the odds of making contact with extraterrestrials by calculating the product of an increasingly restrictive series of fractional values such as those stars with planets,	
and those planets likely to develop life n equals r times fp times ne times fl times fi times fc times l	
yeah, that one	
you can modify it to calculate our chances of having sex by changing the formula to use the number of single women in los angeles, the number of those who might find us attractive,	
and what i call	
the wolowitz coefficient	
"the wolowitz coefficient"	
neediness times dress size squared crunching the numbers,	
i come up with a conservative , potential sex partners within a mile radius	
you're joking	
i'm a horny engineer, leonard	
i never joke about math or sex	
what are we waiting for	
let's bounce, bitches	
you're right	
it's anything can happen thursday	
let's hit the clubs and meet hot women	
here we go	
lock up your daughters	
we're going to hit it and quit it	
or we could finish eating and go to the comic book store	
also a good plan	
but next anything can happen thursday, we're definitely going to a bar	
absolutely	
you heard that, ladies' night ladies	
we're eventually coming for you	
fascinating	
hey, guys where're you headed to the comic book store	
you're probably thinking, "the comic book store on a thursday why, i've fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness"	
what you have failed to take into account,	
is that this is anything can happen thursday	
you got me	
while you're there, could pick me up a few comics for my nephew's birthday	
i think you mean comic books	
"comics" are feeble attempts at humor featuring talking babies and anthropomorphized pets found traditionally in the optimisticallynamed "funny pages"	
could you pick me up a few comics	
for my nephew's birthday	
sure what does he like	
i don't know, he's	
just pick out anything	
"just pick out anything"	
maybe we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size	
or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude	
or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fiber requirements	
or his feelings about little marshmallows	
spiderman get him spiderman	
amazing spiderman, ultimate spiderman，spectacular spiderman, the marvelous adventures of spiderman, spiderman	
you know this can go on all night	
why don't you just come with us	
that's what i was trying to avoid	
i forgot sensational spiderman	
what a cute, little store	
everybody's staring at me	
don't worry, they're more scared of you	
than you are of them	
unlikely	
here, what about this one for my nephew	
a superb choice	
oh, great	
provided he has already read infinite crisis and , and is familiar with the reestablishment of the dc multiverse	
what's a "multiverse"	
get her out of here	
come on, i'll help you pick something	
that's right she's with us	
guys like that are so pathetic	
tell me about it	
look, a new batman belt buckle	
hey, leonard	
can i help you find something	
hey, stuart this is penny	
she's looking for some comic books	
oh, really	
blink twice if you're here against your will	
i think we're fine, stuart	
let me know if you need anything	
thanks	
he seems like a nice guy	
you mean for someone who's into comic books	
i just meant for yeah	
just because people appreciate comic books doesn't make them weirdos	
stuart's a terrific artist	
he went to the rhode island school of design	
what about the guy over there in the superhero tshirt tucked into his sweatpants	
yeah, that's captain sweatpants	
he doesn't really help	
the point i'm trying to make	
got it got it	
got it got it	
need it	
let it go	
why i saw it first	
yes, but i saw it from the front a far less impressive feat	
come on i need this for my batman collection	
i need it for my robin collection rockpaperscissorslizardspock	
why would i gamble	
it's mine let go	
you let go	
no, you	
problem	
he won't let go of my comic book	
it's my comic book	
we need a ruling	
cut it in half	
excuse me	
hello again	
hi what would you recommend as a present for a yearold boy a yearold girl	
but if you're dead set on a comic book, try this	
hellblazer	
what's this about	
a morally ambiguous confidence man who smokes, has lung cancer and is tormented by the spirits of the undead	
if it doesn't make me the favorite aunt, i don't know what will	
is this me	
depends do you like it	
it's really good	
yes, that's you	
that's so sweet,	
but what if i didn't like it	
it'd still be you,	
but i'd feel like an idiot	
i don't believe it	
stuart's putting the moves on penny	
i have got to learn how to draw	
once again, defeated by your own prurient interests	
guys, have you seen stuart	
all up in penny's business over there	
nobody's up in anybody's business	
let's just buy our stuff and go	
okay, you've got my number	
now, give me the picture	
you drive a hard bargain	
but here	
all right	
so, just give me a call	
so, leonard, how are you enjoying anything can happen thursday	
look at that	
that's a dent	
thank you,	
howard "hamfisted" wolowitz	
did you just shut the tv off in the middle of the classic	
deep space nine/star trek	
the original series	
"trouble with tribbles"	
crossover episode	
apparently so	
are you ill all right	
then is it fair to say that you're experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events involving penny earlier this evening	
when did you pick up on that	
a moment ago, when you turned off the tv	
during the classic deep space nine/star trek	
the original series	
"trouble with tribbles"	
crossover episode	
would you like some advice	
sure, why not	
then, this is the perfect time to launch a blog	with an interactive comments section	
thanks a lot	
would you rather i offer my personal insight	
i don't need any insights	
i just want to know why penny's more interested in stuart than me	
we're practically the same guy	
i disagree	
stuart is taller, artistic, selfemployed and, most significantly, he gets  percent off comic books	
you're right i really should be asking strangers on the internet	
my original point	
chinese food, vintage video games	
after the nightmare of anything can happen thursday,	
this is friday night	
the way it was meant to be	
who's up for sheldonfree saturday	
hey, penny and stuart	
hey, guys	
so what are you kids up to	
stuart has a piece in an art show that's opening tonight	
and you guys are going together	
great	
it is great	
really great	
freaking awesome	
what are you guys doing	
it's friday night,	
chinese food and vintage video games, right	
vintage doesn't even begin to describe what we have planned	
tonight, we are playing the classic interactive text adventure, zork	
it's the buggy beta version	
zork well, you guys have fun	
see you guys	
see you, stuart	
hey, howard take me to a bar with women	
really	
yeah	
let me just go inside	
and slip off my underwear	
why	
well, if i get lucky, i don't want to be caught in my aquaman briefs	
do you let's go	
may i have a grasshopper with a little umbrella, please	
no, he may not	
why	
i'm not sitting here with a guy drinking a grasshopper with a little umbrella	
fine i'll have a chocolate martini	
wrong again	
you know i can't talk to women	
unless i'm lit up like the hindu festival of devali	
there are plenty of bars in los angeles where you can order grasshoppers and chocolate martinis,	
but you wouldn't have to	
because there are no women in them	
gotcha	
i'll have a brandy alexander	
all right, the three musketeers just became the dynamic duo	
should we talk to some of these women	
it's way too early	
in the night for that	
first we let the lawyers and the jocks thin the herd, and then we go after the weak and the old and the lame	
that's your system	
that's my system	
and if you spot a chick with a seeing eye dog, she's mine	
come on i think it's nice that captain sweatpants showed up to your art opening	
yeah, it would have been nicer	
if he hadn't touched all the cheese	
you know, it's kind of early	
do you want to maybe come in for some coffee	
gee, it's a little late for coffee, isn't it	
you think "coffee," means coffee	
that is so sweet	
come on i think i have decaf	
good, stuart	
i thought i heard your voice	
do you have a moment	
yeah, i guess	
sheldon, we're a little busy, so	
what are you doing	
we're having coffee	
isn't it a little late for coffee	
it's okay she thinks she has decaf	
i'll just go look for it	
what's up	
i've spent the last three hours in an online debate in the dc comics batman chatroom, and i need your help	
yeah those guys can be very stubborn	
what's the topic	
i am asserting,	
in the event that batman's death proves permanent, the original robin, dick grayson, is the logical successor o the bat cowl	
sheldon, i'm afraid you couldn't be more wrong	
more wrong	
wrong is an absolute state	
and not subject to gradation	
of course it is it's a little wrong to say a tomato is a vegetable	
it's very wrong to say	
it's a suspension bridge	
but returning to the original issue,	
dick grayson became nightwing,	
a superhero in his own right	
batman  has to be the second robin, jason todd has to be has to be	
i hope you're being deliberately provocative	
i found the decaf	
great	
herbal tea for me, please	
barkeep	
alexander me	
how about those two	
they're eating peanuts	
and my allergies, one kiss would put me in cedarssinai for a week	
what about the ones in the corner	
possible very possible	
you want the one in the whiplash collar or the one who keeps blinking	
i think blinky's cute	
you got it, sir	
wait, so we just go over there	
we have a little prep work to do	
put this in your mouth	
we walk past them, you stumble a bit	
i say, sorry,	
my friend's had a little too much	
and then i start to pull it out of your mouth	
and say, "a little too much fun"	
get it	
they're laughing, we're laughing	
then we get them up to about a  blood alcohol level, and tell them we're millionaires	
what else you got	
depends are you willing to sit on my lap and pretend to be a ventriloquist dummy	
i can't sit on your lap	
you don't know the routine	
i'm sorry, but you're obviously stuck in a prezero hour dc universe	
of course i am	
removing joe chill as the killer of batman's parents effectively deprived him of his raison d'être	
throw all the french around you want,	
it doesn't make you right	
au contraire	
plus, you're forgetting that the infinite crisis storyline restored joe chill to the batman mythology	
i am forgetting nothing	
and i resent your tone	
look, sheldon, it's late	
i've got to get some sleep	
so, i win	
no, i'm tired	
so, i win	
fine you win	
darn tootin', i win	
penny, i really had a terrific time	
no, don't wake her	
she'll maul you like a rabid wolverine	
you know, i don't think	
that was decaf	
wait	
is this your card or isn't it	
trust me this was their card	
i thought you were good at this	
you're always talking about how you go to bars and meet women	
i do, all the time	
well, what happened	
we've been sitting here all night and the longest conversation you've had with a woman was when your mom called	
you're just going to make me come out and say it	
say what	
you're weighing me down	
i'm a falcon who hunts better solo	
fine i'll sit here	
you take flight and hunt	
don't be ridiculous	
you can't tell a falcon when to hunt	
actually, you can	
there's a whole sport built around it	
falconry	
shut up	
let's just get koothrappali and go	
lucky bastard	
it's got to be that stupid accent of his	
hello i am sanjay wolowitz from bombay	
okay, i'm stumped
