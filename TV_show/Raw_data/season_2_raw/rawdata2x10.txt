i don't see anything at all	
you're the doctor, but i am constantly	
hearing this annoying sound	
me, too	
is it a highfrequency whistle	
no, it's more of a relentless,	
narcissistic drone	
there's no inflammation at all	 
then it must be a tumor	
seriously doubt it	
maybe it's a lingering bacterial infection	from all those childhood toilet swirlies	
is that possible	
i used to get those all the time	
even in church	
if it is from a swirly,	
there something i can do	
circle, circle, dot, dot,	
now you have a cootie shot	
i'm going to bed	
okay, i'll be right in	
it's not enough that she mocks me,	
but that isn't even	the correct procedure for a cootie shot	
do you understand that stephanie's not here to treat your imaginary ailments	
how is it imaginary that i keep hearing	an octave above middle c	
is that imaginary	
i don't think so	
good night	
one more thing	
under article one, section three of our roommate agreement,	
i'm calling an emergency meeting	
you're not	
leonard moves the meeting not occur	
is there a second	
none heard, the motion fails	
i'd like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on the progress in your relationship with dr stephanie	
thank you	
that being said,	
we have to discuss the implementation of the agreed upon "cohabitation" rider which has been activated now the two of you are living together	
we're not living together	
i beg to disagree	
"a girlfriend shall be deemed	
quote living with unquote leonard	
when she has stayed over for a ten consecutive nights,	
or b more than nine nights	
in a three week period,	
or c all the weekends of a given month	
plus three weeknights	
that's absurd	
you initialed it	
see lh, lh, lh	
wait, i only initialed it	
because i never thought it would happen	
i initialed another clause naming you	
my sidekick in case i get superpowers	
yes, you did	
now, to review, the following provisions	
are hereby activated	
in the refrigerator, as opposed to us having two separate shelves and one communal shelf, the three of us now get	individual shelves and the door becomes communal	
next, apartment vacuuming shall be increased from two to three times a week to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells third	

i'm given to understand	
women have different needs,	
so, we'll have to discuss that	
i'm going to bed	
at least take this with you	
and have stephanie initial here, here, here, here and here	
this states that she does not now nor does she intend to play	
a percussive or brass instrument sure sounds like a tumor	
pressing on the auditory nerve	
no, absolutely not	
it's not a big deal	
we have latex gloves	
i don't care what the symptoms are,	
my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam	
hi, sheldon	
good morning, dr stephanie	
i trust leonard satisfied	
you sexually last night	
we don't ask questions like that	
i heard you ask it over and over	
how is it inappropriate for me to ask it once	
he did very nicely	
see she's not offended	
and now you finally have an answer	
out of coffee need coffee	
hi stephanie, right	
andand you are	
penny, i live across the hall	
i've heard a lot about you	
really	
i haven't heard a thing about you	
why haven't i heard a thing about	
this woman who lives across the hall and comes into your apartment in the morning in her underwear	
she's heard about you because we're,	
you know, involved and you haven't heard about her because	
i never slept with her,	
i swear	
in leonard's defense,	
it wasn't for lack of trying	
thank you	
you're welcome	
look, i'm just saying	
penny is one of our many neighbors,	
and in our building,	
neighbors come and go,	
it's very casual,	
no dress code	
in fact, some mornings	
i'll just mosey down to the third floor	
in my pajamas and have cereal	
with mrs vartabedian	
really	
i have never once been invited to have cereal with mrs vartabedian	
she doesn't like you	
you have a gall bladder to remove and i have to get in the shower and penny has clothes to put on, so it was very nice meeting you	
nice to finally meet you, too	
and i'll see you tonight	
okay, byebye	
what could i possibly have done	to offend mrs vartabedian	
so, that's stephanie, huh	
why do i feel like i'm the one that just got the prostate exam	
you know, she seems very nice	
oh, she is she's terrific	
and she's proving to be a valuable roommate	
you guys are living together	
like hippies	
we're not living together	
do i have to pull out the paperwork again	
we're not living together	
are you sure	
how could i not be sure	
well, let's find out	
don't you think if a woman was living with me	
i'd be the first one to know about it	
sweetie, you'd be the last one	
to know about it	
cute dresses	
i bet this looks great on you	
we're not living together	
scented candles, fuzzy slippers,	
floral bed sheets	
we're not living together	
okay, moving on	
now, who are these guys	at disney world	
the big dog is goofy,	
and the older couple	
with the mouse ears, i have no idea	
we're not living together	
you're going	
to go down swinging, huh	
all right, well,	
we got your body lotion,	
your instyle magazine,	
your jewelry box	
we're not	
where's my bat signal	
you have a bat signal	
i did	
it was right here	
she must've	
oh, my god, we're living together	
really what was your first clue	
new pants	
yeah, stephanie got them for me	
nice cotton	
actually, i think it's more of a wool, fire ant blend	
so, the girlfriend's buying	
clothes for you sounds serious	
it is actually	
in fact, i gave it a lot of thought	
and i decided it was time or us to live together	
leonard, huge mistake	
there's a whole buffet of women out there	
and you're just	standing in the corner eating the same deviled egg	
over and over again	
at least i have an egg	
what do you have	
a veritable smorgasbord of potential sexual partners	
see the blonde over there	
i can hit on her and you can't	
so, go hit on her	
she's not my type	
too bad, 'cause she was	
checking you out before	
she was	
of course not look at her	
i don't care what you guys think	
stephanie and i	are very happy living together	
i will give either of you  dollars,	
right now to trade pants with me	
what are you doing here	
hang on	
over	
it's a little high	
we can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk	
where did you get the stethoscope	
and the blood pressure cuff	
my aunt marion gave them	
to me for my th birthday	
she thought if i failed	
at theoretical physics	
that i should have	
a trade to fall back on	
and by the way, the blood pressure cuff	
is called a sphygmomanometer	
thank you	
didn't they teach you that	
in medical school	
i'm busy here, sheldon	
i understand	
all i need is for you to authorize these tests	
a cardiac stress test,	
a full body mri, an electromyogram,	
a cbc, baseline glucose	
upper gi	
and an exploratory laparoscopy	
last time i had hiccups,	
it felt like my diaphragm was just going through the motions	
go home	
can i at least have the upper gi	
i already drank the barium	
good do you have	
any fabric softener	
yeah, sure	
what are you washing	
a crocodile	
no, the pants that stephanie got me	
sweetie, you can't machine wash these	
they'll be ruined	
are you sure	
absolutely	
i wish you'd told me that sooner	
are you guys having problems	
no, everything's fine	
really	
yeah, it's wonderful	
maybe this whole living together	
happened kind of suddenly,	
but it's fine, it's great	
you know, if you're uncomfortable with the way things are going, you're allowed to say something	
are you sure	
that doesn't sound right	
believe me, your feelings	
are just as important as hers	
no, that doesn't sound right either	
just tell her you need the relationship to move at a pace that you both are comfortable with	
yeah, i could say	
something like that to her	
i'll go do that	
thank you	
sure	
you have a really	
good grasp on this	
maybe you could talk to her	
you're kidding, right	
no, but that's okay	
i'll go talk to her	
want to come with	
go	
what	
you were right	
your larynx is terribly inflamed	
i've never seen anything like it	
i knew it	
what do i do	
you're going to need to stop talking immediately	
for how long	
immediately	
what's going on	
i just performed a "sheldonectomy"	
careful, if you don't get it all,	
it'll only come back worse	
gotcha	
we need to talk	
do we need to talk	
or "do we need to talk"	
i don't know what that means	
why don't you just tell me	
what it is you have to tell me	
look, it's just that	
things between you and me	
have been going pretty quick	
and	
it's just a little scary	
well, yeah, but scary good, right	
sure	
when is scary not good	
but	
i have feelings, right	
okay, and it's perfectly okay to express those feelings, right	
of course, honey, why don't you tell me	
what it is you're feeling	
okay, well, i think	
it's important to remember	
that we move at a pace	
that is our speed and	
oh, shoot, i had it	
how about this	
how about i tell you what i'm feeling	
what's that	
really right now	
why not	
i just ate, aren't you supposed to wait an hour	
i think that's for swimming	
i just hope i don't get cramps	
i put your clothes in the dryer	
thank you	
your pants are ruined	
good	
so, how did the talk with stephanie go	
on one level, really	
really well	
so, you told her you wanted	
to slow things down	
not specifically,	
but i did tell her	
that i had feelings	
good, good	
and then what	
and then	
the subject got changed somehow	
you had sex, didn't you	
little bit	
what	
nothing	
okay, well, it sounds	
like things are going to work out	
it's all good	
everything's going to work out	
one way or another	
god, come on, leonard,	
you are entitled to try and make	
things go the way you want them to	
really	
yes	
you don't always have to go along with what the woman wants	
what	
nothing just	
rethinking my whole life	
here's the thing	
i'm afraid that if i ask her	
to move out,	
she'll just dump me	
it's a chance you have to take	
i mean, look,	
if it's meant to be, it'll be	
very comforting	
what do i say to her	
i don't know	
what have women said to you	
when they wanted to slow	
a relationship down	
i really like you, but i want	
to see how things go with mark	
yeah, that'll slow it down	
i'm sorry, i totally interrupted you	
what were you saying	
right, yeah	
here's the thing	
i really like you	
god, here comes the speech	
what speech	
"i really like you,	
"but maybe we should spend	
a little less time together	
"'cause i need my space	
"but i'll call you on tuesday"	
and then you never call me,	
so i call you,	
but you don't call me back	
and then when i run into you	
at the coffee shop, you pretend	
like you've been having problems	
with your voice mail	
and i know that you're lying,	
but i pretend like i don't care	
even though i'm dying inside	
i wasn't going to say any of that	
i was just going to say	
i really like you	
oh, good	
'cause i really like you, too	
terrific	
nice sweater	
stephanie got it for me	
it's kind of fun	
it's got a big bird on it, dude	
yeah, yeah, that's the fun part	
we're also getting	new curtains for my bedroom,	
and a dust ruffle, and a duvet,	
and i don't even know what a duvet is,	
but i'm pretty sure if i did i wouldn't want one,	
but every time i talk to her about moving out,	
she cries and we have sex	
you're lucky with me,	
it's usually the other way around	
you know, if you can't talk to her,	
why don't you just text her	
isn't that kind of cowardly	
yeah, it's beyond contemptible	
true,	
but on the other hand you are wearing a bird sweater	
sold	
"i think it would be better	
for our relationship	
"if you moved back to your place"	
there	
it's done	
good for you	
good for me	
i'll never have sex again	
i was wrong see ya	
i have an inflamed larynx	
we are out of herbal tea	
do you have any	
okay, let me check	
some hiney would be nice, too	
hiney	
honey
