so, if any of you are considering	
going into experimental physics,	
my door is always open	
once again, i'm sorry	
the demonstration didn't quite work out,	
but now we know what happens	
when you accidentally spill	
peach snapple	
into a helium neon laser	
short answer is don't	
and now to tell you	
about the theoretical physics department	
is dr sheldon cooper	
forget it	
excuse me	
sheldon, we both agreed to do this	
it's a waste of time	
i might as well explain	
the laws of thermodynamics to a bunch of labradoodles	
if you don't do this, i won't take you to the comic book store	
nice work with the laser,	
by the way	
looking out	
at your fresh young faces,    
i remember when i too was	
deciding my academic future    
as a lowly graduate student	   
of course, i was	
and i'd already achieved more	
than most of you could ever hope to,	
despite my  bedtime	
now, there may be one or two of you in this room	
who has what it takes to succeed	
in theoretical physics	
it's more likely that you'll spend	
your scientific careers teaching	
th graders	
how to make papier mache	
volcanoes with baking soda lava	
good god	
in short	
any one who told you	
that you would someday be able to make any significant	
contribution to physics,	
played a cruel trick on you,	
a cruel trick indeed	
any questions	
of course not	
i weep for the future of science	
now if you'll excuse me,	
the latest issue of batman is out	
come, leonard	
laser demonstration's looking	
pretty good now, huh	
i love this time of the year	
the leaves are turning,	
there's a bracing chill in the air	
plus there's a whole new crop of female grad students	
about to put on just enough winter weight to make them needy	
and vulnerable	
that's right, honey,	
have another calzone	
daddy can wait	
isn't there a university policy	
against dating graduate students	
no, if you can talk to them,	
you can ask them out	
damn, there's always a catch	
hey, guys	
hey, leslie	
so, dumbass, i heard you made	
a grad student throw up last night	
the truth can indeed	
be a finger down the throat	
of those unprepared to hear it	
but why should i cater to secondrate minds	
because firstrate minds	
call you "dumbass"	
oh, yeah well	
you're a mean person	
excuse me, dr cooper,	
i'm ramona nowitzki	
i was at your talk last night	
i think you're just brilliant	
that is the prevailing opinion	
now i'm gonna	
throw up	
howard wolowitz,	
department of engineering,	
codesigner of the	
international space station's	
liquid waste disposal system	
i've read	
everything you've published	
i liked your paper on grand unification	
using stringnetwork condensates	
and was wondering how you determined	
that dimensional stringnets	
provided a unified picture of ferrnions	
and gauge bosons	
amazing,	
an intelligent labradoodle	
the fact is i'm quite	
close to a breakthrough	
in showing how neutrinos emerge	
from a stringnet condensate	
my god, that would change the way	
we view the entire physical universe	
it's what i do	
you know, the pishkinwolowitz	
liquid waste disposal system	
is turning a few heads as well	
again, ew	
i'd love to hear more	
about how you intend to add neutrinos	
could we get a cup of coffee sometime	
i don't drink coffee	
i do i love me a cup of joe	
it doesn't have to be coffee	
how about dinner	
i do eat dinner	
great	
i know a terrific italian place	
i never eat in strange restaurants	
one runs the risk	
of nonstandard cutlery	
excuse me	
sheldon lives in fearr of the threetined fork	
three tines is not a fork	
three tines is a trident	
forks are for eating,	
tridents are for ruling the seven seas	
what if i brought food to your place	
that would be acceptable	
on mondays, i eat thai food	
mee krob and chicken sate with extra peanut sauce	
from siam palace	
you got it	
i already have your address	
what a nice girl	
do you have any idea	
what just happened	
yes apparently i'm getting	
a free dinner	
oh, yeah, no, this thing's	
majorly out of order	
see sorry	
that's okay	
guess i'm taking the stairs	
where you going	
a	
you here to see leonard	
no, dr cooper	
dr sheldon cooper	
we're having dinner	
sheldon cooper	
tall, thin,	
looks a little like	
a giant praying mantis	
he is cute, isn't he	
hi, leonard	
hey, ramona come on in	
thanks where should i put this	
the kitchen's fine	
hey, what are you doing	
i need to see this	
the viewing area's right over there	
sheldon, your girl date person	
ramona's here	
hello	
sorry i'm late	
i just got so caught up reading	
the draft of your latest paper	
did you enjoy the humorous footnote	
where i illustrate mirrorsymmetry	
by likening it to the flash	
playing tennis with himself	
so funny	
but the idea that you might be able to incorporate gravity,	
i have to tell you,	
i found it physically exhilarating	
my hypotheses tend to have that effect	
i'm sorry i didn't bring enough	
for your friends	
i assumed we were going to be alone	
no, we were just going to watch, right	
no, come on, now, we're going out	
come on, we'll be quiet	
let's go	
okay, you two	
have a nice	
whatever this is	
okay, you guys, look,	
i know this is none of my business,	
but i just i have to ask	
what's sheldon's deal	
what do you mean "deal"	
you know, like what's his deal	
is it girls guys	
sock puppets	
honestly, we've been operating	
under the assumption	
that he has no deal	
come on, everybody has a deal	
not sheldon	
over the years,	
we've formulated many theories	
about how he might reproduce	
i'm an advocate of mitosis	
i'm sorry	
i believe one day sheldon will eat	
an enormous amount of thai food	
and split into two sheldons	
on the other hand, i think sheldon	
might be the larval form of his species,	
and someday he'll spin a cocoon	
and emerge two months later with moth wings and an exoskeleton	
okay, well, thanks	
for the nightmares	
hey, do you want to	
hang out with us	
what are you guys gonna do	
my mom's making a brisket tonight	
the one with the little onions	
yeah, i'm busy, so	
good night	
her loss let's go	
brisket party	
b tothertotheisk	
totheetothet	
don't	
aren't you having breakfast	
yes	
are you experimenting with	
nutritional suppositories again	
not in these pants	
so how'd it go with ramona last night	
great	
she's smart, insightful	
and she has a very unique way	
of, you know, revering me	
here's your spinach mushroom omelet	
thank you	
did anyone touch it	
gloves were worn by everyone involved	
i was vigilant	
ramona pointed out	
that i've been wasting  minutes a day	
standing on cafeteria lines	
time which would be better spent	
tackling the great physics	
problems of our day	
you don't tackle the big issues	
you fence with them	
en garde riposte	
touche	
morning	
hey, lesly	
so i see you're organizing	
your papers	
for the smithsonian museum of dumbassery	
there won't be any room	
until they get rid the permanent leslie winkle exhibit	
good one	
i see you got a grad student to fight your battles for you	
i'll let you keep	
your lunch money today	
dr cooper is on the verge of a breakthrough	
if you're going to stay,	
you'll have to be respectful and quiet	
wait for me	
have you worked out	
the neutrino issue	
well, to paraphrase mozart,	
all the subatomic particles are there	
i just have to put them	
in the right order	
you're so witty	
aren't i	
hey, guys,	
this package came for	
dr cooper is working	
yes, i'm close to a breakthrough	
it tickles	
sorry	
holy crap on a cracker	
you probably don't want to go in there	
why what are they doing	
the only way i could explain it would be	
in a therapist's office with dolls	
boy	
dr cooper's working	
yeah, i can see that	
sheldon, halo night, koothrappali's	
you coming	
yes, it's halo night	
let me just dry my tootsies	
you're not going to halo night	
yes, i am	
it's wednesday	
wednesday's halo night	
didn't a great man once say,	
"science demands nothing less	
"than the fervent and	
unconditional dedication	
"of our entire lives"	
he did	
and who was that great man	
me	
sorry, leonard	
seriously you're not coming	
you heard her	
how can i argue with me	
okay, well, once again,	
you guys have a good	
whatever this is	
dr cooper, i have to tell you	
your friends are holding you back	
i prefer to think of it	
as "i'm pulling them forward"	
halo night	
a man with your intellectual gifts doesn't waste an evening playing video games	
he does on wednesdays	
not if he wants a nobel prize	
he does want that	
does a man with my intellectual gifts	
play paintball on weekends	
what do you think	
drat	
now shall we get back to work	
i suppose	
battlestar galactica	
comes on tonight	
i guess i can wait for the dvd	
and then, never ever watch it	
sheldon, honey, i've told you,	
it's a small apartment	
you only have to knock one time	
i don't have a lot of time	
ramona finally dozed off,	
and i need you to help me get rid of her	
get rid of her how	
i don't know,	
but apparently	
i'm in some kind of relationship,	
and you seem to be an expert	
at ending them	
excuse me	
i see man after man	
leaving this apartment never to return	
okay, first of all, it is not man after man	
hide me	
hide you	
i formally request sanctuary	
why aren't you working	
she distracted me	
i told you, penny,	
i don't have time for your nonsense	
i have important things to do	
oh, man	
i know what's going on here	
really	
then will you explain it to me	
you're in love with dr cooper	
yeah, no, that's not it	
don't try to deny it	
he's a remarkable man,	
but you have to let him go	
gee, okay	
i know it's hard,	
but he's a gift to the whole world,	
and we can't be selfish	
yeah, he's a gift all right	
sisters	
sure	
sisters	
holy crap on a cracker	
what are you doing	
it's morse code	
why	
so we can communicate	
through the wall	
we are communicating	
through the wall	
yes, but the communication	
is not encrypted	
i don't know morse code	
it's very simple this is a	
this is b	
this is c	
i'm not going to learn morse code	
at  in the morning	
all right	
don't come in here,	
don't come in here	
what's going on	
ramona's sleeping on the couch	
i know	
when is she going home	
never that's the problem	
i need your help	
what are you talking about	
i'm invoking the skynet clause of our friendship agreement	
that only applies if you need to help you destroy	
an artificial intelligence	
you've created that's taking	
over the earth	
come on don't nitpick	
good night	
all right	
i'm invoking	
our body snatchers clause	
the body snatchers clause requires me to help you destroy	
someone we know	
who's been replaced with an alien pod	
she's in the living room	
go i'll wait here	
sheldon,	
what are you doing out of bed	
now do it	
you know you need your sleep	
in order for your cognitive processing perform at optimum levels	
now come on	
godzilla clause	
not unless she destroys tokyo	
rats	
i've got it	
i finally reconciled	
the black hole information paradox with my theory of stringnetwork condensates	
it's unbelievable	
it's paradigmaltering	
i could not have done it without you	
please, i just offered	
a little encouragement	
it was a lot more than that	
you helped me work out	
the masses of all the fermions	
and you pumiced my hammer toe	
how can i ever repay you	
would you consider naming it	
the coopernowitzki theorem	
who's nowitzki	
i'm nowitzki	
you want me to share credit	
get out	
bite me	
sisters	
excuse me, dr cooper	
i'm kathy o'brien	
i just finished reading your paper	
reconciling the black hole	
information paradox with your theory of stringnetwork condensates,	
and it just took my breath away	
maybe when i publish it,	
i'll include an inhaler	
would you possibly have any time for me to pick your brain	
let's see today's thursday	
thursday nights, i eat pizza	
from giacomo's	
sausage, mushrooms, light olives	
great	
i'll bring it to your place	
i have the address	
what a nice girl	
sheldon, do you see	
what just happened here	
yes, i'm getting a free pizza	
i'm on a roll	
more pad thai, please	
sheldon, you've already had	four servings	
you might want to slow down a bit	
just one more bite	
are you okay	
i'm just so	
full	
that's it no more thai food
