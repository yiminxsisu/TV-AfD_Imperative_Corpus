penny, hello	
hey, sheldon	
what is shaking	
i'm sorry	
it's colloquial,	
a conversation opener	
so, do you find he weather satisfying	
are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team	
what's wrong with you	
you're freaking me out	
i'm striking up a casual conversation with you	
s'up	
please don't do that	
all right, but i'm given to understand	
that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone,	
it's more palatable to preface it	
with banal chit chat	
so, this wasn't	
the awkward part	
all right	
s'up	
oh, good, i used that right	
anyway, you're aware that leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship which includes a sexual component	
okay, feeling the awkward now	
her name is dr stephanie barnett	
and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at freemont memorial	
leonard told me	
good	
what he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me	
to you	
see, of the handful of women	
leonard's been involved with,	
she's the only one	
i have ever found tolerable	
well, what about me	
the statement stands for itself	
aren't you sweet	
anyway, should you have	any interaction with her, it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival	
yeah, i think she's pretty safe	
you say that now,	
but consider the following scenario	
you're sitting in your apartment,	
it's late, you're alone	
your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone	
and suddenly even leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate	
or a "hookup"	
as it's referred to	
by today's urban youth	
really	
yes now, should that happen, i would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido	
i could think about you	
fine, whatever works	
always nice talking to you, sheldon	
peace out	
this is very pleasant	
glad you're enjoying yourself	
and you said there'd never be enough pasta for the three of us	
i stand corrected	
you know, italian housewives	
have a rule of thumb	
a handful of dry pasta	
about an inch in diameter is sufficient for each person	
as it doubles in volume when cooked	
that's very interesting	
thank you	
she doesn't mean it	
she's just being nice	
well, since leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball,	
i guess i'll just have to pick it up	
have you ever witnessed a violent crime	
no	
good	
what's your favorite fruit	
strawberries	
technically not a fruit,	
but all right	
where did you do	
your medical internship	
lawrence memorial in galveston, texas	
really that's where i was born	
you're kidding	
i spent so much of my childhood at that hospital	
when i was ,	
i got to ride there in a helicopter	
why, what happened	
radiation burns	
a little mishap while i was building my own cat scanner	
i'm sorry, you tried to build your own cat scanner	
no, i didn't try, i succeeded	
in fact, i was briefly able to see the inside of my sister's guinea pig, snowball, before he caught fire	
it led to an interesting	
expression in our house	
"not a snowball's chance	
in a cat scanner"	
excuse me	
when i come back, just for fun,	
the subject will be alternative history	
specifically, how would the civil war have gone differently	
if lincoln had been a robot sent from the future	
look at that,	
there's even pasta left over	
do you understand	
that this was supposed to be a date	
i do do you	
because frankly,	
you've been in a foul mood since i sat down	
okay, here's my question	
why did you sit down to help	
look, if you fail at this relationship,	
and history suggests you will,	
then we risk losing the medical officer	
that our landing party has always needed	
what landing party	
you're kirk, i'm spock,	
wolowitz is scotty,	
koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed	
and now we've got mccoy	
so, we're all standing around	
looking at the postop x ray	
and there it is, clear as day,	
right in the guy's chest cavity	
one of my earrings	
oh, my god, what did you do	
what do you think i did	
i discreetly slipped off the other earring, put it in my pocket	
and then got the hell out of there	
i have a bone to pick with you, sir	
hi, sheldon	
hi, stephanie i'm sorry i'm late,	
but your companion left	
the most indecipherable invitation	
what invitation	
"we're going to the movies"	
what movie what theater what time	
if you were trying to make it	
impossible to locate you,	
you couldn't have done a better job	
clearly i could have	
it took me nearly  minutes to browse the history on your computer to see what movie	
times you looked up	
wait here, i'll find us seats	
we have seats	
not the right seats	
what is he doing	
he's finding the acoustic sweet spot	
does he always do this	
sometimes he brings	a toy xylophone	
i am really sorry about this	
no, it's fine	
you know, he's sweet	
my apologies, you've been	
sitting in it all along	
you want to slide over one	
no, just sit here	
oh, yeah, this is it	
what, sheldon	
what, sheldon what, sheldon	
tell me what you see here	
the blunt instrument that will be	
the focus of my murder trial	
this is stephanie's facebook page	
now, where it should say	
"in a relationship," what does it say	
"stephanie barnett is single"	
furthermore, earlier this evening,	
she threw a digital sheep	
at some guy named mike	
who's mike	
why does he get a digital sheep	
and not you	
it's just her facebook page	
and we've only been going out a couple of weeks	
you don't see it, do you	
we're losing her	
i'm going to make this very simple for you	
you are not in this relationship	
i am	
ergo, you have no say in anything that happens	
between me and stephanie	
i'm afraid i can't allow that	
pursuant to starfleet	
general order ,	
section a you are deemed unfit	
and i hereby relieve you of your command	
general order , section a does not apply in this situation	
give me one good reason why not	
because this is not star trek	
what	
this is banana bread	
this is a door knob	
it's my understanding	
that an unsolicited gift of food can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat	
would you like to come in	
i suppose i could spare	
a few minutes	
were you robbed	
how can you be sure	
what do you want	
i'm certain this will come	
as no surprise to you,	
but leonard is failing	
in yet another relationship	
he's having problems with stephanie	
she's sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet	
if i have any hope of keeping	
them together, i need data	
specifically, i need to know exactly what leonard did that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks	
what	
again, urban slang	
in which, i believe i'm gaining	
remarkable fluency	
so, what is the "down"	
and the "low"	
and don't worry,	
this is all entirely confidential,	
so, you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom	
we never got to the bedroom	
because	
all right, you know what	
i'll tell you what happened	
we were young,	
we were very much in love,	
but we could only communicate	
through a timetraveling mailbox	
at my lake house	
it's not enough that you made me	
watch that movie,	
but now you mock me with it	
gentlemen, i have a question	
about dating and relationships	
you told me you were going to have the talk with him	
i've been waiting for someone to have the talk with me	
more to the point,	
it's about finding a way to keep leonard	
and stephanie together	
i don't think you can	
why not	
look at leonard's record	
days with joyce kim	
during which she defected to north korea	
two booty calls with leslie winkle	
for which she awarded him the nickname	
"speed of light leonard"	
and the three hour dinner with penny	
which would have been two and a half	
if they ordered the souffle	
when they sat down	
based on the geometric progression,	
his relationship with stephanie	
should have ended after  minutes	
yes, i'm aware of the math	
y equals  days over  to the nth	
the issue remains	
how do we circumvent	
his inevitable rejection	
if you want to guarantee	
his appeal to stephanie,	
your best bet would be to kill	
all the other men on the planet	
here's what you shouldn't do	
don't shpritz him with that body spray	
from the commercial where the women	
undress when they smell it	
that doesn't work at all	
no matter how much you put on	
that's all you've got	
apocalyptic genocide	
and "go easy on the cologne"	
what	
zucchini bread	
thank you	
may i come in	
i see	
apparently, my earlier inquiry	
regarding you and leonard	
crossed some sort of line	
i apologize	
well, thank you	
have you and i returned to a social equilibrium	
yes	
great	
new topic	
where are you	
in your menstrual cycle	
what	
i've been doing some research online,	
and apparently, female primates,	
you know, apes,	
chimpanzees, you	
they find their mate more desirable	
when he's courted by another female	
now, this effect is intensified	
when the rival female is secreting	
the pheromones	
associated with ovulation	
which brings me back to my question	
where are you	
clearly, i'm  days too early	
all i'm saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria,	
why can't they do something	
about lactose intolerance	
leonard, you're going to have to let this go	
you had a little cheese dip, you farted	
i thought it was cute	
you want some more wine	
yeah, i mean	
i assume i'm not driving	
anywhere tonight	
what are you doing	
i have a craving	
for white asparagus	
that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied	
excuse me	
what is wrong with you	
i'm helping you with stephanie	
by making constipated moose sounds	
when i fail to open this jar	
and you succeed,	
it will establish you	
as the "alpha" male	
you see when a female	
witnesses an exhibition	
of physical domination,	
she produces the hormone oxytocin	
if the two of you	
then engage in intercourse,	
this will create	
the biochemical reaction in the brain	
which lay people naively interpret	
as "falling in love"	
would it work if i just	
punched you in the face	
yes, actually it would,	
but let's see how the lid goes	
i'm not strong enough, leonard,	
you'll have to do it	
for god's sakes	
go ahead, it's preloosened	
you want some help with that	
i got it	
he's got it,	
and that's not surprising	
it's something i long ago	
came to peace with	
in my role as the beta male	
open it	
are you okay	
no, i'm not	
i'm bleeding	
like a gladiator	
honey, you're going to need stitches	
stitches with a needle	
well, yeah, i mean, just a few	
yeah, hang on a sec	
fyi, i was defrosting	
a steak in there	
what a beautiful job stephanie did	
i might have gone with a mattress suture	
instead of a blanket stitch,	
but you can't argue	
with her results	
it's a shame it won't scar	
the war wound is a timehonored	
badge of masculinity	
i can't remember a time	
when you weren't talking	
just for the record, my efforts to establish you as the alpha male	
were not aided by you	
bursting into tears	
i did not burst into tears,	
my eyes just got a little watery	
watery	
she stuck a needle into my hand	
hey, how's my big cry baby	
i didn't cry	
i'm just teasing you	
but, yeah, you did	
it's all good what do you say	
we get you home and put you to bed	
are you still going to spend the night	
no, i think that you probably	
need to rest	
she's right as long as you're vomiting,	
coitus is contraindicated	
thank you, dr cooper	
you're welcome, dr hofstadter	
okay, i'm going to go	
get your discharge papers	
what	
you seem like	
a perfectly pleasant person	
i can't understand why women	
have such a hard time loving you	
can you open this for me	
can i see your stitches	
sure	
answering the question	
once and for all	
why wolowitz bailed out	
of medical school	
leonard, congratulations	
what for	
your facebook status update	
leonard hofstadter is	
"in a relationship"	
what no, that's not right	
oh, man, did you switch	
your status before she did	
speaking as an expert,	
way to look needy	
seriously you went first,	
after only two weeks	
that's bold	
it's not bold, it's a mistake	
i didn't change my status	
well, then who did	
i had no choice	
he cried in front of her	
you hacked my facebook account	
it's hardly hacking	
when you use the same password for everything, "kalel"	
are you insane	
now she's going to think i'm desperate	
you've destroyed this relationship	
and you know what the worst part is	
you don't even understand	
what you did wrong	
because you can't conceive of something	
that you are not an expert in	
in which i am not an expert	
don't even	
i don't want to hear another word out of you	
what's wrong, lassie	
timmy fall down the well	
she just updated	
her facebook status	
"stephanie barnett is in a relationship "with leonard hofstadter"	
really	
look at that	
i have a girlfriend	
if i am permitted to speak again,	
dr sheldon cooper for the win
