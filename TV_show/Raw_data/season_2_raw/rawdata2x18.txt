knight to queen's bishopfive	
very nice	
what's leonard going to do	
give up the pawn	
or give up the position	
let's find out	
ready	
ready	
go	
damn it i slipped	
too bad you know the rules of secret agent laser obstacle chess	
leonard died again,	
sheldon you're up	
despite my deep love of chess, lasers and aerosol disinfectant, i must forfeit	
why	
because it's almost	
so	
penny has a "don't knock on my door before or i punch you in the throat" rule	
you know what'd be a great idea	
we get some girls over here and play laser optical strip chess	
believe me, any girl who would be willing to play that,	
you don't want to see naked	
you underestimate me	
hey, sheldon	
it's  am	
i know you're safe	
this package came while you were at work	
great, my rhinestones	
thank you	
excuse me	
what	
you have to sign this	
what is it	
when i signed for the package, i was deputized by the united parcel service and entrusted with its final delivery	
i now need you to acknowledge receipt of the package so that i'm fully indemnified and no longer liable	
it's just a box of rhinestones	
the contents are irrelevant	
a legal bailment has been created	
does that mean nothing to you	
it means nothing to anybody	
let me show you what i'm doing	
"bailment" describes a relationship	
in common law where a physical possession of personal property,	
or "chattels," is transferred from one person, the bailor, to another person, the bailee	
look, look	
i started a business	
obviously, not a cleaning business	
no, i'm making flower barrettes	
see	
i call them penny blossoms	
i made one for myself, then all the girls at work wanted one	
i showed some to this lady who runs a shop in old town	
she sells cards and homemade jewelry	
she said she wanted to sell them	
i said, "okay"	
and in one week, i made a $	
good for you	
sign here	
don't you get it if this takes off,	
i won't have to be a waitress anymore	
but then who will bring me my cheeseburger on tuesday nights	
another waitress	
what's her name	
i don't know	
and you're going to let her handle my food	
nancy her name is nancy	
i think you're just making that up	
i'm sorry about your hamburger	
i just don't want to be a waitress for the rest of my life	
cheeseburger	
i get a cheeseburger	
fine, cheeseburger	
maybe i'd be better off with nancy	
so, what do you think	
i mean, this could be a business, right	
how many of these can you make a day	
about	
and how much profit do you make per penny blossom	
like, cents i'm not sure	
of course you're not	
all right	
ten dollars a day times five days a week times  weeks a year is $,	
that's all	
before taxes	
i don't have to pay taxes on this stuff	
i believe the internal revenue service would strongly disagree	
but, if you took advantage of modern marketing techniques,	
and you optimized your manufacturing process,	
you might be able to make this a viable business	
and you know about that stuff	
i'm a physicist	
i have a working knowledge of the entire universe	
and everything it contains	
who's radiohead	
i have a working knowledge of the important things in the universe	
good luck	
sheldon, hold on	
could you maybe show me how to make more money with this	
of course i could	
wait	
will you	
just to be clear here,	
you're asking for my assistance	
and you understand that will involve me telling you what to do	
i understand	
and you're not allowed to be sarcastic or snide to me while i'm doing so	
good	
let's begin with the premise that everything you've done up to this point is wrong	
oh, imagine that	
sarcasm goodbye	
no, sorry wait	
please come back	
there done	
all right	
minutes and  seconds	
pretty good, right	
that's  penny blossoms per hour	
based on your cost of materials and your wholesale selling price, you'll effectively be paying yourself $ a day	
"a day"	
there are children in a sneaker factory in indonesia who outearn you	
that just can't be right	
you're questioning my math	
no, sorry	
want me to show my work	
god, no	
please tell me what to do about it	
all right are you familiar with the development that resulted from honor√© blanc's	
use of interchangeable parts	
the assembly line, of course	
if i'm not allowed to be snide,	
you're not allowed to be condescending	
that wasn't a part of our original agreement, and i don't agree to it now	
fine	
how are we supposed to set up machines and conveyor belts in my apartment	
you're thinking of the moving assembly line,	
an understandable but not excusable mistake	
the moving assembly line, that was introduced by henry ford in	
that innovation is what made possible our modern consumer culture by enabling a lowunit cost for manufactured goods	
i guess that isn't one of the topics	
discussed on your radiohead	
let's go we're going to miss the coming attractions	
what's the matter	
i think i bruised a testicle	
capturing that last pawn	
please pay attention and listen to me	
give me some time to blow the man down	
i'm a deepwater sailor	
just come from hong kong	
to me way, hey,	
blow the man down	
if you give me some whiskey i'll sing you a song	
give me some time to blow the man down	
hello	
hello	
come quickly lay aft to the break of the poop	
to me way, hey,	
blow the man down	
or i'll help you along with the toe of my boot	
give me some time to blow the man down	
what's going on	
i assume you're referring to the sea shanty	
it's a rhythmic work song designed to increase productivity	
it's crazy, but it totally works	
we made this penny blossom in under three minutes	
terrific, but that kind of raises more questions than it answers	
penny's making hair accessories	
i'm helping her optimize her manufacturing process	
break's over	
pay attention to orders	
now you one and all hold on what are you using as a bonding agent	
hot glue	
you're kidding	
any of the cyanoacrylates would do a better job	
the flower's too porous	
what if we infused the bottom layer with siliconertv to providea better mounting surface	
intriguing	
what are your marketing and distribution channels	
there are the waitresses at my work, and this cute, little shop in old town	
virtually nonexistent	
i'm thinking that we set her up with a hosted ecommerce system to start	
why not eliminate the middle man	
we could install a small server farm with a static ip in her bedroom with an industrial cooling system	
of course, but before we set up marketing and distribution,	
we should finish optimizing the manufacturing process	
to start with,	
she has a terrible problem with moistureinduced glitter clump	
yeah, it's a bitch	
i've seen this before	
where	
it's a common stripper problem	
they dance, they sweat, they clump	
are you thinking about adding a desiccant like calcium sulfate	
actually, i'm thinking about this one stripper named vega	
but sure, calcium sulfate	
could work	
let's think out of the box for a moment	
how about a molecular sieve	
i've got a spaghetti strainer in the kitchen	
we could liberate some microporous charcoal from the chem lab	
great	
raj, why don't you and howard, go get the charcoal	
leonard, why don't you start working on some preliminary web site designs	
i'll make some space in our apartment so we can move the manufacturing process	
what's wrong with my apartment	
it's not my apartment	
wait, what am i going to do	
it's your business	
do whatever you want	
okay, cool	
i'm going to take a nap	
i'm still tweaking things a little bit,	
but this will give you the general idea of the web site	
so, what do you guys think	
pretty much any way i say that is going to hurt his feelings	
okay, what's wrong with it	
what's wrong with it	
not you i wasn't asking you	
well, it's a little juvenile	
it kind of looks like the myspace page	
of a yearold girl	
no, it doesn't	
please dateline could use it to attract predators	
this is your enterprise,	
so it's ultimately your decision,	
but based on the quality of his work,	
i'd strongly recommend that we let leonard go	
you want to fire me	
what i want is irrelevant	
this is penny's decision	
excuse me, but if i did such a bad job then why do we already have orders	
we do	
look	
mrs fiona fondell from huntsville, alabama has ordered two	
no kidding two	
look at the comments	
"thank you, penny blossoms "these will be perfect to cover my bald spot"	
that is so sweet	
camouflaging bald spots	
that's primarily a male concern	
perhaps we could expand our market	
how are flower barrettes going to appeal to men	
we add bluetooth	
brilliant men love bluetooth	
wait a minute, you want to make a hair barrette with bluetooth	
everything is better with bluetooth	
holy crap someone just ordered a thousand penny blossoms	
get out	
who needs a thousand sparkly flower barrettes with rhinestones	
"the fifth annual east rutherford, new jersey, gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender alliance luau"	
another market to expand into balding gay men	
and i'll bet lesbians love bluetooth	
we should get to work	
wait, why does it say "oneday rush"	
since when do we offer a oneday rush	
amazon offers oneday rush	
yeah, but they don't have to glue the books together	
how the hell are we going to make a thousand penny blossoms in one day	
don't yell at me i'm not manufacturing	
i'm just web design	
i'm gonna have to call them and cancel the order	
excuse me,	
but was this not your goal financial independence through entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation	
my brilliance and innovation,	
of course, but still	
i just don't see how we can pull this off	
that, right there,	
that equivocation and selfdoubt,	
that is not the american spirit	
did davy crockett quit at the alamo	
did jim bowie	
they didn't quit	
they were massacred by like a gazillion angry mexicans	
let me put it this way	
your gross receipts on this one order will be over $, for one night's work	
you guys get started	
what are you doing	
going online to buy shoes	
she'll be coming round the mountain	
when she comes	
she'll be coming round the mountain	
when she comes	
she'll be coming round the mountain	
you know, if i wanted to spend my saturday nights doing this,	
i could have stayed in india	
stop with the fake third world crap	
your father's a gynecologist	
and you had a house full of servants	
we only had four servants	
and two of them were children	
how we doing	
we have  assorted penny blossoms	
ready to ship	
we're never gonna finish in time	
who made sheldon the boss anyway	
i believe i'm hearing some negativity on the factory floor	
so	
penny	
the labor force is a living organism that must be carefully nurtured	
any counterproductive grumbling must be skillfully headed off by management	
observe	
less talk, more work	
nicely done	
thank you	
you hear any union talk,	
you let me know	
someone's in the kitchen with dinah	
someone's in the kitchen	
i knowowowow	
someone's in the kitchen with dinah	
'cause i sold my soul to the company store	
honey, do you want some coffee	
i don't drink coffee	
but if you don't stay awake	
we'll never finish in time	
sorry, coffee's out of the question	
when i moved to california,	
i promised my mother that i wouldn't start doing drugs	
leonard, help	
sheldon, we still have of these things to make	
i have complete faith that you will make them	
good night	
but, sheldon,	
without your insight and leadership, this entire enterprise will surely fail	
you're right, of course	
here, this will help	
very well,	
but if this leads to opiates or hallucinogenics,	
you're going to have to answer to my mother	
look at planck's constant	
people say it's arbitrary	
it could not be less arbitrary	
if it varied slightly,	
life as we know it would not exist	
bam	
now, now, let's reconsider the entire argument, but with entropy reversed	
and effect preceding cause	
so you are thinking of a universe	
that's not expanding from the center	
no, it is retreating from a	
from a possibility space	
this is a space	
where we are all essentially alice through the looking glass, standing in front of the red queen, and we're being offered a cracker to quench our thirst	
of course, in another universe,	
let's call it universe prime	
we should have let him go to bed	
i can't believe we actually did it , friggin' penny blossoms	
i just want you guys to know	
i am really grateful for your help	
and for ever dollar i make, i'm going to give you  cents	
that's your entire profit margin	
then never mind	
i'll print out the shipping label	
what	
we got an email from the east rutherford, new jersey,	
gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender alliance	
they want another thousand penny blossoms	
really	
oneday rush	
i really need to take that off the web site	
guess we'd better get started	
you can't be serious	
come on	
what about the living organism of the workforce	
and the american spirit and jiminy crockett at the alamo davy crockett	
jiminy crockett was a cricket	
yes, i know that, okay i'm tired	
i've had like  cups of coffee	
the point is, if we just pull together we can do this	
who's with me	
although you may find it hard to believe,	
we do have lives	
sorry	
my apologies to the gay community of east rutherford, new jersey	
where's the coffee	
we're all out	
no problem	
i'll be back before this banana hits the ground	
sorry, guys, but secret agent	
laser obstacle lunch is just stupid
