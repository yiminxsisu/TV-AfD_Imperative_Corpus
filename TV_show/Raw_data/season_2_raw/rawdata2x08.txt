oh, look,	
saturn  is on	
i don't want to watch saturn	
deep space nine is better	
how is deep space nine better than saturn	
simple subtraction	
will tell you it's six better	
compromise watch babylon	
in what sense is that a compromise	
well, five is partway between three never mind	
i'll tell you what	
how about we go rock-paper-scissors	
i don't think so	
anecdotal evidence suggests that in the game of rockpaperscissors, players familiar with each other will tie  to % of the time due to the limited number of outcomes	
i suggest	
rockpaperscissorslizardspock	
what	
it's very simple	
scissors cuts paper	
paper covers rock	
rock crushes lizard	
lizard poisons spock	
spock smashes scissors	
scissors decapitates lizard	
lizard eats paper	
paper disproves spock	
spock vaporizes rock	
and as it always has,	
rock crushes scissors	
okay, i think i got it	
rockpaperscissorslizardspock	
hello, boys	
ahoy, matey	
noticed the eye patch, did you	
it's all part of a technique	
i've been studying for picking up women	
you employ a visual display	designed to make yourself distinctive and memorable	
oh, yes, like the male peacock with brilliant plumage	
or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters	
or in this case,	
the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye	
mock me if you will,	
but it works	
you show up at a club	
in something distinctive,	
scope out your target	
and toss out some negs	
what are negs	
a neg is a negative compliment	
that throws a pretty woman	
off her game,	
like "normally,	
i'm not turned on by big teeth,	
but on you, they work"	
i got a whole list of 'em	
who wants to be my wingman	
you're not gonna need a wingman	
you're gonna need a paramedic	
your scooter's blocking my car	
did you get pinkeye again	
step one	
she notices the eye patch	
may i say, penny,	
not a lot of women	
could look as hot as you do	
with such greasy hair	
just move your stupid scooter	
before i pick it up	
and throw it in the dumpster	
i'm sorry, but i'm not going to watch the clone wars tv series	
until i've seen the clone wars movie	
i prefer to let george lucas	
disappoint me in the order he intended	
i want to watch it now	
then i believe we've arrived at another quintessential rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock moment	
watch whatever you want	
i saw what you did there	
what'd i do	
what's wrong	
okay, we'll be right there	
what happened	
howard's at the mars rover lab	
he says he's in trouble	
defcon	
defcon	
well, there's no need to rush	
what	
defcon  means "no danger"	
defcon  is a crisis	
how can	
not be worse than	
star trek v worse than i	
first of all, that's a comparison	
of quality, not intensity	
secondly, star trek i is ordersofmagnitude worse	
than star trek v	
are you joking	
star trek v is the standard	
against which all badness is measured	
no, no	
star trek v has specific failures	
in writing and direction,	
while star trek i	
fails across the board	
art direction, costuming,	
music, sound editing	
can we just forget i said defcon and go	
star trek v	
will you at least stipulate	
that star trek iv the voyage home is inarguably the best	
i have three words for you	
wrath of khan	
thank god, you're here	
what's the emergency	
i got the mars rover stuck in a ditch	
where	
on a dusty highway	
just outside bakersfield	
where do you think	
on mars	
is everything okay	
yeah, baby, i'll be right in	
you brought a girl to the mars rover control room	
yeah, i picked her up in the bar	
she's a doctor	
one free barium enema,	
and my mother won't care	
she's not jewish	
wait a minute	
so the eye patch and the insults worked	
no, there were three other guys	
with eye patches it was a fiasco	
what did work was, "how'd you like to visit a secret government facility"	
so what exactly	
do you want us to do	
you and raj help me	
get the rover out of the ditch	
and you get stephanie out	
before somebody notices her	
she doesn't exactly have clearance	
really	
they don't let strange	
women from honkytonks	
come in and play with $ million	
government projects on distant planets	
yes, i was bad	
maybe she'll spank me	
can we please move on	
it's getting late,	
so do i get to drive this thing or what	
no i'm sorry,	
but something's come up	
kind of a mars rover	
mars rover	
can howard come over	
situation	
so my friend leonard is gonna take you home	
okay let's go, friend leonard	
i'll call ya	
so are you a scientist like howard	
no one's a scientist like howard	
my mother is so gonna love her	
how nice maybe they can carpool	
when they visit you in federal prison	
i'm sorry	
i totally interrupted you	
what were you saying	
just said howard's a terrific guy	
he's got a great sense of humor	
he loves his mother	
a lot	
people say "too much"	
i really like	
that you're such a loyal friend	
yeah, i am loyal	
if you look at the big picture	
out of curiosity,	
did he ever have a shot with you	
are you insane	
the guy was wearing an eye patch	
then why did you	
he said that i could drive a car	
on mars	
got it	
so, can i see you again	
you're not gonna see me now	
cool	
anything	
actually, i was just	
checking my email	
but, no,	
the rover is not responding	
i believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement and a native american water vessel without any means of propulsion	
hang on	
there's got to be other options	
you could try calling triplea	
but based on nasa's latest timetable,	
they won't get there for  years	
plus i understand	
you have to be standing next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive	
oh, snap	
snap what	
i guess we have to turn to plan b	
what's plan b	
erase hard drives, scrap surveillance tapes, wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run	
why wasn't that plan a	
a nasa spokesman states	
that due to the loss of data,	
they will most likely be unable to determine the cause	
of the mars rover's malfunction	
thank god for plan b	
didn't you say	
you worked on the mars rover	
no, you're mistaken	
when we first met,	
you said that if i went out with you,	
i could drive a car on mars	
i don't know	
what you're talking about	
will you all excuse me	
leonard is subtly signaling	
that he'd like to talk to me in private	
no i remember specifically	
you started by asking	
if i was from mars	
because my ass	
was out of this world	
that does sound like me,	
but no	
is there some problem	
listen, i have to kinda	
sneak out for a while	
all right, goodbye	
no, wait	
if anyone asks you where i went, you don't know	
where are you going	
i can't tell you that	
who would ask me	
i can't tell you that, either	
you brought me in here to inform me	
you can't tell me where you're going	
and you can't tell me	
who might ask	
yeah, i really didn't	
think this through	
leonard, a moment	
what	
if someone, and of course,	
we don't know who this would be,	
does ask where you've gone,	
what should i say	
i don't know	
just tell 'em i went to the office	
are you going to the office	
no	
then how can i say it convincingly	
just say,	
"leonard went to the office"	
all right	
leonard went to the office	
what is no, not like that	
just, "leonard went to the office"	
it would've worked out a lot better if you'd just told me you were going to the office	
i'm going to the office	
see why don't i believe you	
i'm going out for a while	
doesn't anyone want to know	
where he's going	
okay, where is he going	
leonard is going to the office	
so how was work today	
busy	
i removed an appendix,	
a gall bladder	
and about a foot	
and a half of bowel	
i'm hoping that was	
three different guys	
no, just the one	
he didn't make it	
so, how was your day	
you know, i'm a physicist, so	
i thought about stuff	
that's it	
i wrote some of it down	
are you done eating	
yeah	
good	
if i knew you were waiting,	
i would've swallowed that lasagna whole	
you've reached dr stephanie barnett	
leave a message	
it's me again, howard	
if you're free friday,	maybe we could have a little something to eat at my place	
my mom cooks a hell of a brisket	
let me know	
it's howard	
i've had her brisket	
melts in your mouth	
maybe we should think about going to the bedroom	
good idea	
there's a bed in there,	
and i'm very, very, very probed	
you've reached dr stephanie barnett	
leave a message	
hey, it's me again	
just want to let you know	
the head count for dinner friday has gone up	
my aunt betty and uncle elliot are coming in from palm springs	
if anybody should ask, you're half-jewish on your mother's side	
okay, call me	
it's howard	
don't you think we should tell him you're not interested	
do you want me to stop	
and call him back right now	
dear god, no	
you've reached dr stephanie barnett	
leave a message	
hey, it's me again	
my cousins from fort lauderdale are flying in to meet you	
so that means we're gonna	
have to move the dinner to a restaurant	
tell her we're going to the olive garden	
i have a coupon from the paper	
we're not going to the olive garden, ma	
mr bigshot with his red lobster	
i'll call you back	
when we firm up the details	
it's howard	
new shirts	
yeah, a couple	
nice	
thank you	
so, who's the girl	
i'm sorry	
well, last time you bought a new shirt	
was when we were dating	
so what we did	
was in fact dating	
well, yeah, we did have a date	
exactly thank you	
do me a favor, tell koothrappali that next time you see him	
so, who is she	
she's a doctor	
nice	
a doctor doctor,	
or a you kind of doctor	
doctor doctor	
surgical resident	
smart, pretty	
let me ask you something	
if your friend thinks	
he's dating someone,	
but he's not because, in fact,	
you're dating her,	
does that make you a bad person	
that depends	
on what	
is that friend wolowitz	
screw him you're fine	
are you sure	
well, have you slept with her yet	
you dog	
good for you	
does that change things	
no	
so why'd you ask	
i'm nosy	
see ya	
howard, get the door	
really is that what you do	
when someone knocks	
thank you i had no idea	
hey, buddy what brings you to my little slice of hell	
who is it	
it's leonard	
you're gonna have to play outside	
i'm not dressed to receive	
no one cares, ma	
so, what's up	
listen, i need to talk to you	
about something	
momentito	
yello	
thanks for calling me back	
i was worried	
no, i understand	
sure, we can be friends	
absolutely	
thanks for calling	
you have a nice day, too	
you are dead to me	
who gets the extra dumpling	
rockpaperscissorslizardspock	
okay, one of us is going to have to stop putting up spock	
how do we decide that	
hey, guys	
hello	
hi, howard	
howard is employing	
a schoolyard paradigm	
in which you are,	
for all intents and purposes, deceased	
he intends to act on this	
by not speaking to you,	
feigning an inability to hear you	
when you speak	
and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence	
that's just ridiculous	
why are you cooperating with him	
i don't make the rules, leonard	
howard, come on	
i didn't plan on this	
these things just happen	
usually not to me,	
but they do happen	
did someone just feel	
a cold breeze	
i believe this is an extension	
of the death metaphor	
the cold breeze is the socalled	
ectoplasmic issue	
of a disembodied soul passing by	
screw it	
i'm just gonna eat the dumpling	
come on in	
is this a bad time	
yes, but i don't see	
a better one on the horizon	
if it isn't mrs dead to me	
i'm sorry, you violated	
the terms of your metaphor	
by acknowledging her existence	
i'm out	
he just won't listen to me	
okay, i guess it'll just be	
the three of us then	
lisa's gonna be disappointed	
lisa	
my roommate she just went through a really bad breakup,	
i thought she might like to meet somebody fun like you	
leonard, stephanie,	
you're alive	
it's a miracle	
so, anyway, lisa,	
i just wanted to tell you again	
how much i enjoyed the other night,	
and again,	
i'm sorry for how it ended	
but again, if you could	let me know about friday	
my mother needs a head count	
so she can know	
how big a brisket to get	
howard, look at this	
anyway, call me	
it's howard	
it's unclear how the mars rover	
got into the crevice,	
but one thing's certain	
the data which it has sent back	
contain the first clear indications	
that there may have been	
life on mars	
it's a scientific discovery	
that has staggering implications	
for all mankind	
unfortunately, we'll never know	
who's responsible	
son of a bitch
