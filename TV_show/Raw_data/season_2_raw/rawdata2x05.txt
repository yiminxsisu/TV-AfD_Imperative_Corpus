good morning	
we're gonna have to stop by pottery barn on the way to work	
i bought these star wars sheets, but,	
they turned out to be	
much too stimulating to be compatible	
with a good night's sleep	
i don't like the way	
darth vader stares at me	
i'm not going to work	
just because your career's	
been stagnant for a few years,	
that's no reason to give up	
i was up all night	
using the new freeelectron laser	
for my xray	
diffraction experiment	
did the laser accidentally	
burn out your retinas	
no	
then you can drive let's go	
ddn't i tell you	
i'd be working nights and that	
you'd have to make	
other arrangements	
you did	
and	
i didn't	
let's go	
good night	
but how am i going to get to work	
take the bus	
i can't take the bus anymore	
they don't have seat belts,	
and they won't let you latch yourself to the seat with bungee cords	
you tried to latch yourself to the seat with bungee cords	
i didn't try i succeeded	
but for some reason,	
it alarmed the other passengers	
and i was asked to debus	
you're a big boy	
you'll figure it out	
don't talk to me like i'm a child	
now, take me to return my star wars sheets	
what is it	
leonard's asleep	
thanks for the update	
no wait	
you have to drive me to work	
yeah, i really don't think i do	
but i don't drive,	
and i can't take the bus	
you'll be fine as long as you don't do	
that bungee cord thing, okay	
didn't you recently state	
that you and i are friends	
yes, sheldon we are friends	
then i hereby invoke	
what i'm given to understand	
is an integral part	
of the implied covenant of friendship	
the favor	
oh, dear god	
i'm sorry, i didn't realize	
i was interrupting your morning prayers	
when you're done, we'll go	
thank you for driving me to work	
you know this is my day off	
oh, good	
i'm not keeping you from anything	
your "check engine" light is on	
typically that's an indicator to, you know, check your engine	
it's fine	
it's been on for, like, a month	
actually, that would be	
all the more reason to	
you know, check your engine	
sheldon, it's fine	
if it were fine,	
the light wouldn't be on	
that's why the manufacturer installed	
that light, to let you know it's not fine	
maybe the light's broken	
is there a "check the 'check	
engine light' light"	
what	
studies have shown	
that performing tasks	
such as eating, talking on a cell phone	
or drinking coffee while driving	
reduces one's reaction time	
by the same factor	
as an ounce of alcohol	
do you have any alcohol	
of course not	
too bad	
you're going up euclid avenue	
leonard takes los robles avenue	
good for leonard	
euclid avenue is shorter	
as the crow flies,	
but it has speed bumps,	
which appreciably increase	
pointtopoint drive time,	
making it the less efficient choice	
but you have the conn	
if you're not going to slow down for the speed bumps,	
i withdraw my previous objection	
here's a fun question	
do you know what the most	
common street name is	
no	
the answer's tricky	
it's second street	
you'd think it would be first street,	
but in most towns,	
first street eventually	
gets renamed to something else	
you know,	
like main street,	
broad street	
michigan avenue	
leonard and i	
often use our commute time to exercise our minds	
with brainteasers like that	
we also play games	
would you like to play one	
no	
come on it's fun	
another bump	
okay i'll say an element,	
and you say an element	
whose name starts with the last letter	
of the one i said, okay	
i'll start	
helium	
now, you could say "mercury"	
that would give me a "y"	
very clever that's a tough one	
so i go with "ytterbium,"	
which gets you back to "m"	
so you go "molybdenum,"	
and i say "magnesium"	
you say "manganese"	
i say "europium,"	
and, then, you're left	
with "mendelevium,"	
and there are no more m's	
because i believe that meitnerium	
should still be called ekairidium	
so, congratulations you win	
do you wanna go again	
why don't we just have	
a little quiet time now	
all right	
i'm sorry	
i'm finding your reckless nonchalance	
regarding the checkengine light to be very troubling	
get out	
i have to tell you that while i do have	
a theoretical understanding	
of the workings	
of an internal combustion engine,	
i'm not sure i'm capable	
of performing diagnostics	
i said, "get out"	
okay i'll give it a shot	
there you are	
i'm ready to go home	
i just got here	
good perfect timing	
i told you, i only have access to the freeelectron laser at night	
i can't drive you	
for the next few weeks	
no, you said you couldn't	
drive me to work	
this is from work	
howard, help me out here	
no, just for the fun of it,	
i'm gonna take his side	
now,	
how do you propose i get home	
how did you get here	
in the first place	
penny	
but i sense	
that's no longer an option	
i need to get to the laser lab	
you're just gonna have to find someone else to take you home	
damn, i picked the wrong side	
god, not euclid avenue	
why did howard leave you	
in the middle of the road anyway	
we had a difference of opinion	
over what	
whether or not	
he was trying to kill me	
for the record,	
i maintain he was	
where are you going	
i'm taking you home	
but i'm not going home	
it's wednesday	
wednesday's new comic book day	
we have to go to the comic book store	
then, we have to stop at souplantation	
it's creamy tomato soup day	
and radio shack	
there's a sale on triplea batteries	
plus, we have to go to pottery barn and return my star wars sheets	
i have a better idea	
you want to go to pottery barn first	
can you drive me to pottery barn	
maybe if i turn off the nightlight,	
i can keep the sheets	
good morning	
good morning	
sheldon, sit down	
she's in my spot	
don't look at me like that	
everybody knows that's my spot	
you know that we care about you	
and it's because we care about you	
that we've decided we have to speak up	
you're hurting the people	
around you, sweetie	
so we made you an appointment,	
and we want you to keep it	
department of motor vehicles	
new driver handbook	
but i don't have a problem	
sheldon, you need to learn how to drive	
this madness has to stop	
penny's taking you to the dmv	
i'm going to bed	
why penny	
because rock breaks scissors	
good night	
all right, come on, sheldon	
hold on	
i have one condition	
what	
we have to stop at pottery barn	
and radio shack	
fine	
and the comic book store	
all right	
i want to go to the comic book store	
i like comic books	
i still don't see	
why i need a driver's license	
albert einstein never had	
a driver's license	
yeah, but albert einstein	
didn't make me wet myself	
at  miles an hour	
yeah, and i never wanted to kick	
albert einstein in the nuts	
i gotta ask, why didn't you just get	
a license at  like everybody else	
i was otherwise engaged	
doing what	
examing perturbative amplitudes	
in n= supersymmetric theories	
leading to a reexamination of the ultraviolet properties of multiloop n= supergravity	
using modern twistor theory	
well, how about	
when you were	
take this to the testing area,	
put your name at the top,	
sign the bottom, answer the questions,	
bring it back next	
application	
i'm actually more of a theorist	
the application in your hand	
give it to her	
take this to the testing area, put your name at the top, sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it black	

excuse me, but i have some concerns about these questions	
look at that sign up there	
does it say "i give a damn"	
that's because i don't	
just look	
this first question makes no sense	
"how many car lengths should you leave	
in front of you when driving"	
there's no possible way to answer that	
a "car length" is not	
a standardized unit of measure	
look at the sign	
it's "c" just put down "c"	
i don't need your help, penny	
listen to that little girl, honey	
put "c" next	
wait hang on	
look at this next question	
why are you arguing with the dmv	
how else are they going to learn	
look question two	
"when are roadways most slippery"	
now, there are  answers,	
none of which are correct	
the correct answer is	
"when covered by a film of liquid	
"sufficient to reduce	
the coefficient of static friction	
"between the tire and the road to essentially zero,	
"but not so deep as to introduce	
a new source of friction"	
here's your learner's permit	
go away	
but i'm not done	
i have many additional concerns	
about these questions	
don't make me climb over this counter	
come on	
next	
aced it	
that's it	
let's boot it up	
booting	
this is a stateoftheart simulator	
i adapted it from something	
a friend of mine designed for the army	
is that why i appear to be	
in downtown fallujah	
behind the wheel	
of an uparmored humvee	
i haven't configured it yet	
let's see	
bradley tank	
transport truck	
batmobile	
here we go	
red  ford taurus	
on the streets of pasadena	
what	
statistically, red cars	
are stopped by police	
far more often	
than any other color	
i don't want any hassles	
with the fuzz	
fine, what color do you want	
you know the pale blue	
of luke skywalker's lightsaber	
before it was digitally remastered	
black, it is	
okay, now, what you want to do first is turn on the ignition and shift into drive	
i haven't fastened	
my seat belt yet	
okay, fasten your seat belt	
now, are there air bags	
you don't need air bags	
what if a simulated van	
rearends me	
i'll hit you in the face	
with a pillow	
okay, now shift into drive	
pull out slowly into traffic	
watch out, watch, watch out	
for the pedestrians	
wait slow	
hit the brakes the brakes	
thank you	
sorry excuse me	
my bad	
student driver	
how did you manage to get	
on the d floor	
of the glendale galleria	
i don't know	
i was on the pasadena freeway	
i missed my exit,	
flew off the overpass,	
and one thing led to another	
maybe you want to give it a rest and try again tomorrow	
i quit	
the pet store	
remind me to compliment wolowitz	
on the software	
it's amazingly detailed	
so wait, you're just	
gonna give up	
no, i'm not giving up	
i never give up	
so, what is it you're doing	
i'm	
transcending the situation	
i'm clearly too evolved for driving	
what does that mean	
have you ever wondered	
why my little toes and lateral incisors	
are significantly smaller	
than the average for someone of my size	
i wonder a lot of things about you	
but notnot that	
well, those are indicators	
that i'm farther along	
the evolutionary scale	
than the average human	
no kidding	
hold on	
i'm not gonna go so far as to say	
that i represent a distinct	
new stage in humankind	
you know, a homo novus,	
if you will	
that's for anthropologists to decide	
but i am convinced	
that the reason i cannot master	
the plebeian task of driving	
is because i'm not meant to	
yes, you are	
you're meant to learn how to drive	
please learn how to drive	
i'm meant for greater things,	
like unraveling the mysteries	
of the universe,	
not determing when it's safe to pass a stopped school bus	
on a country road	
it's never safe	
yeah, well, i know that now	
fine	
assuming that everything	
you say is true,	
how does the biologically superior	
homo novus get to work tomorrow morning	
homo novus doesn't know	
well, hang in there	
maybe you'll evolve	
into something with wings	
good morning, gentlemen	
good morning	
is there some new kind of casual friday	
i don't know about	
no, he lives here now	
really why	
since he won't take the bus	
and he's too evolved to drive,	
he decided it would be easier to sleep in his office	
and shower in the radiation lab	
until i'm finished	
with my experiment	
but you finished your experiment	
a week ago	
you saw nothing
