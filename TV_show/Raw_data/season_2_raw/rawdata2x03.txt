fellow warriors,	
this is sheldor the conqueror	
we are about to enter axidus' fortress	
now, this is a long run, so let's do another bladder check	
all right, barry, we'll wait for you again,	
but you really  should see a doctor	
sheldor is afk	
penny, are you experiencing some sort of difficulty	
yes i can't get  my stupid door open	
you appear to have put  your car key	
in the door lock are you aware of that	
yeah	
all right, then	
damn it,	
damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it	
would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly	
i can't get the damn key out	
well, it's not surprising that baldwin lock on your door	
uses traditional edgemounted cylinders,	
whereas the key for your volkswagen	
uses a center cylinder system	
thank you, sheldon	
you're welcome	
why did you put	
your car key in the door lock	
why i'll tell you why because today i had an audition,	
it took me two hours  to get there,	
i waited an hour for my turn,	
and before i could even start,	
they told me i looked too midwest	
for the part	
too midwest what the hell does that even mean	
well, the american midwest was mostly settled	
by scandinavian and germanic people	
they have a characteristic facial bone structure	
i know what it means, sheldon	
god you know, i have been in la for almost two years now,	
and i haven't gotten  a single acting job	
i've accomplished nothing, haven't gotten	
a raise at work, haven't   even had sex in six months,	
and just now, when i was    walking up those stairs,	
a fly flew in my mouth  and i ate it	
well, actually, insects are a dietary staple in many cultures	
they're almost pure protein	
oh, son of a bitch	
i believe the condensation on your frozen foods	
weakened the structural integrity of the bag	
but returning to your key conundrum,	
perhaps you should call a locksmith	
and have him  open the door for you i did	
he said he'll get here   when he gets here	
and you're frustrated  because he phrased his reply	
in the form of a meaningless tautology no	
i am frustrated because i am a failure at everything	
and my breath smells like fly	
there, there	
would you prefer to wait in our apartment	
no, sheldon, i'd rather sit on this freezingcold floor	
sobbing like a threeyearold	
all right, then	
for heaven's sake	
just when i think i've gotten the hang of sarcasm	
make yourself comfortable	
not there	
sheldor is back online	
sheldor	
the conqueror	
what are you doing	
afk	
i'm playing	
age of conan,   an online multiplayer game set in the universe of robert e howard's	
conan the barbarian	
sheldor back online	
what's "afk"	
afk	
away from keyboard	
oh, i see	
what does that stand for	
oh, i see	
yes, but what does it stand for	
now, just click on the enchanted boots to put them on	
mm, i don't know can i see them in another color	
just click on them	
yeah, congratulations	
you are now a levelthree warrior	
what's going on leonard,  guess what	
i'm a levelthree warrior	
great	
do you know there are groceries outside of your apartment	
yeah, yeah, yeah shh	
i only bring it up because your ice cream's melting	
and it's starting to attract wildlife	
uhhuh, yeah	
do i stay in the jungle or go towards the beach	
it doesn't matter right now; you're looking for treasure	
wait, wait, where are you going	
no, no you're okay	
if you run into crocodiles, just kick them with your boots	
you want to catch me up	
well, let's see, uh,	
she attempted to open her apartment with her car key	
because her face is overly midwestern, um	
she hasn't had sex in six months	
and she ate a fly	
seriously  six months	
oh, my god	
a treasure chest i'm rich	
level three, and she thinks she's rich	
what a newb	
okay	
we're all set	
let her rip	
hi	
check it out it's just   corn starch and water	
they make up	
a nonnewtonian fluid, which is liquid,	
but solid under the percussive action of the speaker	
that's what makes it get all funky	
yeah okay	
uh, listen, i need to talk to sheldon	
no, that's what she said sheldon	
okay, i'm in the game,	
and i've been exploring the island of tortage,	
but i can't figure out how to get past the guard captain	
do you have the enchanted sword	
no, no, i have a bronze dagger	
you can't slay the guard captain with a bronze dagger	
my lord, it's like the car key	
in your apartment door all over again	
all right, how do i get the sword	
well, have you been to the temple of mishra	
is that the place on the hill with	
the weird priest in front of it no, no, no, it's	
oh, for god's sakes, gimme	
thank you i really appreciate this	
you're gonna have to learn	
to do these things for yourself, penny	
don't patronize me just get the sword	
what the frack	
beats me	
they were playing all last night, too	
it's like some kind of weird comic book crossover	
like if hulk were dating peppermint patty	
i always thought peppermint patty was a lesbian	
no, that's marcie	
peppermint patty's just athletic	
there you go one enchanted sword	
all right, gimme, gimme, gimme	
i want to kill the guard captain	
that girl needs to get a life	
sheldon	
sheldon	
danger danger	
no danger  it's just me, penny	
listen, i got to level	
and reached purple lotus swamp, right	
you're in my bedroom	
leonard gave me an emergency key	
people can't be in my bedroom	
well, can we go talk in the living room	
i'm not wearing pajama bottoms	
why not	
i spilled grape juice	
well, wear different pajamas	
i can't wear different pajamas  these are my monday pajamas	
penny, people cannot be in my bedroom	
okay, fine, just tell me, is it too soon	
to join a quest to the black castle	
you were invited on a quest to the black castle yeah, yeah	
by some guys in budapest	
i'm just not sure it's the right move for my character	
of course it's not   you're only a level	
these hungarians,	
they're just using you for dragon fodder	
really boy, you'd think you could trust	
a horde of hungarian barbarians	
please, penny, enough	
i have to sleep	
okay, well, you were great	
thanks	
oh hey, leonard listen,  don't go in sheldon's room	
he's not wearing bottoms	
sheldon, you want  to catch me up again	
people, i am very busy today	
i realize that, dr gablehauser,	
but it is your job, as  head of the department,	
to mediate all interdepartmental disputes, university policy manual, chapter four, subsection two "mediation of interdepartmental disputes"	
fine	
dr winkle, what colorful name	
did you call dr cooper this time	
dr dumbass	
dr cooper, dr winkle apologizes	
no, i don't no, she doesn't	
here's the problem	
i was clearly signed up	
to use the mainframe in buckman ,	
and dr winkle just wantonly	
ripped the signup sheet off the wall	
it wasn't even an official signup sheet	
he printed it himself, and he put his name down	
on every slot for the next six months	
if it is a crime	
to ensure that the university's resources	
are not being squandered chasing subatomic wild geese,	
then i plead guilty	
oh, penny  do you need	
to get that, dr cooper	
god, no well, don't turn it off,	
you might miss your call from the nobel committee	
letting you know you've been nominated as dumbass laureate of the year	
oh, yeah well	
you wouldn't even be nominated	
dr gablehauser,  i have a series	
of important calculations  and simulations to run	
all she's doing is reducing irrelevant data	
and making a mock	
excuse me	
gablehauser	
it's for you	
hello	
penny, this is not a good time	
no, i told you,	
you're not prepared for the sanctum of burning souls	
you need to be in a group of at least five for that quest	
and one should be a level  healer	
penny, i can't log on and help you	
we'll talk when i get home	
i'm not getting the computing time, am i	
dumbass	
leonard, you have to do something about penny	
she is interfering with my sleep,	
she's interfering with my work,	
and if i had another significant aspect of my life,	
i'm sure she'd be interfering with that, too	
why should i do something	
you're the one who introduced  her to online gaming yes,	
but you're the one who said hello to her when she moved in	
if you'd simply restrained yourself,	
none of this would be happening	
why don't you just tell her to leave you alone	
i did, i told her,	
i texted her, i sent out a very emphatic twitter	
i even changed my facebook status to "sheldon cooper wishes penny would leave him alone"	
i don't know what else to do	
well, what am i supposed to do	
i don't know, but if you don't figure something out,	
i warn you, i shall become very difficult to live with	
you mean up until now we've been experiencing the happy, funtime sheldon	
yes i'll go talk to her	
no, fritz, i need you on my flank	
no, i don't know german	
flankenzei, flankenzei	
hey, penny, busy	
yeah, i see that	
shouldn't you be at work	
i don't work on mondays	
it's thursday	
listen, penny,	
queen penelope, afk	
what	
here's the thing	
sometimes people, good people,	
yeah, they start playing these games	
and they find themselves	
through no fault of their own	
you know, kind of addicted	
yeah, get to the pointi'm about to level up here	
it's just if a person doesn't have	
a sense of achievement in their real life,	
it's easy to lose themselves in a virtual world	
where they can get a false sense of accomplishment	
yeah, jabber, jabber, jabberokay, boys,	
queen penelope's back online	
penny, you've got, cheetos in your hair	
oh thanks	
hey, penny, it's me again, leonard	
leonard, i said not now	
i know, i'm just a little concerned about you	
i said not now	
okay, maybe later	
hey, guys	
hey, what's with him	
penny's been keeping him up at night	
me, too	
but probably in a different way	
she's gotten really hooked on age of conan	
she's playing nonstop	
ah, yes, online gaming addiction	
there's nothing worse than having	
that multiplayer monkey on your back	
sheldon, wake up	
danger danger	
afternoon, men	
sheldon	
oh, yeah	
well, your attempt at juvenilizing me	
by excluding me from the set of adult males, just,	
oh, i'm too tired to do this	
righti heard you've been pulling allnighters with middle earth barbie	
she comes into my room	
no one's supposed to be in my room	
i would postulate that she's escaping into the online world	
to compensate for her sexual frustration	
i do that, too	
but probably in a different way	
that's not what she's doing, leslie	
she's just trying to shore up her selfesteem	
it has nothing to do with sex	
everything has to do with sex	
mm, testify	
i'm not touching that	
leslie, you are way off base here	
hang on, leonard	
while i have no respect for leslie as a scientist	
or a human being,for that matter,	
we have to	concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields	of promiscuity and general sluttiness	
thank you	
my point is that tinker bell just needs to get her some	
some what	
oh, yes, some sexual intercourse	
i'll take the bullet	
excuse me, this whole idea is insane	
enough debate, i'm going to take action	
excuse me	
are you currently involved in a sexual relationship	
no	
would you like to be	
uh, sure, why not	
sheldon	
puhpuhpuh	
can i have your phone number	
uh, yeah	
there problem solved	
dumbass	
okay, i'm at the gate to the treasury of the ancients	
i'm going in	
stay close to the wall	
avoid the mummies got it	
i must say you're playing very well for a woman of	twentytwo	
right,	
oh, here come the mummies	
which spell do i use, the hateful strike	
or the frenzy stance	
what happened to the rest of your group	
i dumped them, they're a bunch of wussies	
frenzy stance	
frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy	
so, listen, would you describe your ideal vacation	
as a wild adventure to unknown lands	
or staying at home curled up with a good book	
what	
these are market research questions	
i'm filling out the online registration for your game	
oh, okay, wild adventure	
oh, frenzy stance isn't working	
die, you undead mummy, die	
drink a healing potion	
thank you you're welcome	
anyhow, on a scale of one to five, with one being always initiated by him and five being always initiated by you, how do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin	
that's on the registration	
oh, yes, it's quite extensive	
but if we complete it,	
you get a free expansion pack	
 additional quests	
ooh, awesome, okay, i totally like to initiate	
i'm a big ol' five	
good to know	
big ol' five	
hello	
hi	
leonard, this is tom	
hi, tom   sheldon	
didn't i explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria	
yes,	
you were very clear	
as was everyone else at the table	
tom, however, has been chosen by science	
as a suitable mate for penny chosen by science	
well, what passes for science on dating sites	
they claim to use heuristic algorithms,	
but it may well be hokum	
you got penny to sign up for online dating	
no, of course not	
see, i used trickery and deceit	
this is bad	
tom is a paramedic with the fire department,	
but he's going to med school at night	
he likes the outdoors	
and, uh, strong women who initiate sex	
really, really bad	
i'm surprised you struck out with penny	
apparently, she's a big ol' five	
sheldon, what do you want	
oh, good,	
you got my note	
penny, i'd like you to meet tom	
penny, this is tom	
tom, may i present penny	
hi, penny	
yeah, hey listen	
as long as i'm here,	
i'm on a quest with a bunch of newbs	
they don't know what they're doing	
we've got one assassin, three spell casters and no tank	
can we talk about this later	
no, no, no, no, i need you now	
wouldn't you prefer to socialize with tom,	
who is a sexually passive outdoorsman	
whatever i'll figure it out myself	
bye, penny	
i'm sorry, dude, she didn't look anything like her picture	
they never do	
hello, fair penny	
who are you	
it is i, sir howard of wolowitz	
can i interest you in an afternoon of spirited questing followed by a flagon of ale at yon virtual tavern	
yeah, sure, why not	
oh, my god, i need help
