oh "worf," nice too bad that's a proper noun	
oh, look, the's the future mrs wolowitz

oh, what a coincidence it's the future mrs wolowitz	
yeah, and they can all move in with you and your mother	
the current mrs wolowitz	
is "qochbe'" spelled with a (gargling) or a (guttural grunt)	
why is that mrs wolowitz crying	
that's anais	
none of the other girls in the house like her	
house what house	
they all live in a house together	
a house, where	
i don't know somewhere in la	
wait a minute	
you're telling me that i'm within driving distance	
of a house filled with aspiring supermodels	
yeah, i guess	
and they live together and shower together and	
have naked pillow fights	
hey, whwhere are you going to pay my cable bill	
all right, pencils down	
i have "lokh," "makh," and "cherrrkh"	
anybody got those	
did i miss anything	
did they kick giselle off	
not yet, but her underwater photo shoot	
was an embarrassment	
sadly, mrs giselle wolowitz is sensitive to chlorine	
lucky for her i like my fashion models pruny and bugeyed	
sheldon, the food's here	
ooh, there's the house	
freeze frame, freeze frame	
what are you doing	
marking the star positions and physical landmarks	
so we can find the house of the supermodels	
why	
isn't it obvious	
every week, they kick out a beautiful girl,	
making her feel unwanted and without selfesteem	
aka the future mrs howard wolowitz	
is my hamburger medium well yes	
dill slices, not sweet yes	
individual relish packets yes	
onion rings yes	
extra breading i asked	
what did they say no did you protest	
yes vociferously no	
well, then what took you so long	
just eat	
hey, guys, what'd i miss what'd i miss	
giselle's hanging by a thread	
oh, good, i hate her	
then you're not invited to our wedding	
here you go	
thank you	
oh, do we have to suffer through this	
transparently manipulative pseudoreality again	
yes	
you and i have a standing tv schedule,	
which is the result of extensive debate and compromise	
any alterations except for breaking news	
have to be preapproved at the weekly roommate meeting	
put it on the agenda	
but you have to make a motion to put it on agenda	
oh, i'll make a motion, but you're not going to like it	
fine mock parliamentary procedure	
at least put it on mute	
oh, giselle's not getting kicked off	
it's totally going to be summer	
what	
sheldon's onion ring just put it back	
it's one onion ring	
just put it back before he comes	
no, no, no	
no, i don't think that's where it was	
okay, here he comes  deny, deny, people	
wall of silence	
who touched my	
penny penny did it	
why would you do that	
i don't know i was hungry	
what's the big deal	
the big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate	
all right look, i didn't know, i'm sorry	
well, i'm sorry, but that is your second strike	
what	
you have two strikes	
three strikes and you're out	
it's a sports metaphor	
a sports metaphor	
yes, baseball	
all right, yeah ii'll play along	
what was my first strike	
march th	
you violated my rule about forwarding email humor	
i did	
the photo of the cat who wants to "has cheezeburger"	
oh, come on everybody loves "lol cats"	
they're cute and they can't spell 'cause they're cats	
i trusted you with my email address,	
and you betrayed that trust by sending me internet banality	
strike one	
touching my food strike two	
don't worry they only stay on your record for a year	
you can get them removed early, but you have to take his class	
come on, i touched one onion ring	
yeah, and then you put it back,	
compromising the integrity of all the other onion rings	
oh, honey, the buses don't go where you live, do they	
look, penny, i wish i could be more lenient with you,	
but since you've become a permanent member of our social group,	
i have to hold you to the same standards as everybody else	
congratulations you're officially one of us	
one of us, one of us	
well, what a thrill	
you're sitting in my spot	
oh, jeez, you've got to be kidding me	
leonard, she's in my spot	
yeah, yeah uh, see, here's the thing	
after you leave, i still have to live with him	
i don't care i'm taking a stand	
metaphorically	
all right, that's it strike three	
ooh, strike three	
i'm banished	
what the hell kind of crap is that	
listen, don't worry i'll talk to him	
yeah, you do that	
just so i know, would you be open to taking his class	
you can do it online	
so based on our triangulation,	
we've narrowed down the location of the top model house three square miles in the hollywood hills	
or possibly durham, noh carolina	
when we find it, you want to go with us	
to do what	
party with the pretty girls, dude	
are you insane	
you're not going to party with them	
you're not even going to get anywhere near that place	
that's what they said to neil armstrong about the moon	
no one said anything of the kind to neil armstrong	
the entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure	to put a man on the moon	
well, my fellow americans, before this year is out,	
we will put a wolowitz on one of america's top models	
and a large number of people will believe it never happened	
okay, let me guess	
a quesadilla with soy cheese for the lactoseintolerant leonard	
thank you	
shrimp caesar salad with no almonds	
for the highly allergic kosheronlyonthehighholidays howard	
and for our suddenly "back on the hindu wagon" raj,	
the meatlover's pizza, no meat	
coming right up	
wait excuse me	
you forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger,	
barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side	
oh, i didn't tell you	
you're banished from the cheesecake factory	
why	
well, you have three strikes	
one coming in two sitting down	
and three i don't like your attitude	
you can't do that	
not only is it a violation of california state law,	
it flies directly in the face of cheesecake factory policy	
yeah, no, there's a new policy	
no shoes, no shirt, no sheldon	
i bet we could sell that sign all over pasadena	
penny, can i talk to you for a minute	
well, here's the thing	
um, i talked to sheldon	
and he feels terrible	
and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line	
really well, that's great	
yeah, so just apologize to him, okay	
what i'm not going to apologize to that nutcase	
oh, come on it's easy	
he'll even tell you what to say	
leard, don't you get it	
if you guys keep going along with his insanity,	
you're just encouraging him	
we're not encouraging	
it's more like knuckling under	
look, i like hanging out with you guys,	
but i'm not going to apologize for something i didn't do	
well, actually, technically, you did do it	
that's strike one, leonard	
there you go quesadilla	
salad	
there's your pizza	
and thanks to sheldon's heated discussion with my manager	
one barbecue bacon cheeseburger,	
barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side	
thank you	
go ahead eat it	
i dare you	
that's it there's the house	
i foundamerica's top models	
are you sure	
look, on the roof	
anais and giselle are sunbathing	
europeanstyle	
you can recognize people on google earth	
of course not	
i got a buddy of mine at norad to have a spy drone fly over	
norad you're using military aircraft	
it was already targeted to poke around	
a nuclear reactor in siberia	
i took it an hour out of its way, tops	
okay, where is he	
sheldon i just dropped him off at the comic book store why	
here try and go online	
problem with the wifi just try	
greetings, hamburger toucher	
you are probably wondering	
why you cannot im with your little friends	
about how much you "heart" various things	
this recorded message is alerting you	
that i am putting an end to your parasitic piggybacking upon our wifi	
if you want to remedy the situation,	
you can contact the phone company,	
set up your own wifi and pay for it, or you may apologize to me	
well	
i reiterate knuckle under	
no, no, no, no, no it is on	
i am gonna introduce your friend to a world of hurt	
oh, penny, you don't want to get into it with sheldon	
the guy is one lab accident away	
from being a supervillain	
i don't care i was in junior rodeo	
i can hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds	
no need to neuter the nerd	
i can get you back online	
there, see problem solved	
voil	
sheldon hello, puny insects	
as a consequence of your efforts to circumvent my will,	
everyone is awarded one additional strike	
thanks a lot, howard	
what are you complaining about	
i'm the one who has to take the class again	
hello	
time to do your laundry, huh	
it's saturday night	
saturday is laundry night	
i know	
every saturday at	
easy to anticipate	
what are you implying	
i'm implying that you're a creature of habit	
and if something were to prevent you from doing your laundry	
on saturday at ,	
you might find it	
unpleasant	
knuckle under my ass	
oh, no, are all the machines taken	
what are you gonna do	
no problem	
i'll just do my laundry another night	
another night	
well, i guess you can try,	
but deep inside your heart,	
you'll know that laundry night is always saturday night	
woman, you are playing with forces beyond your ken	
yeah, well, your ken can kiss my barbie	
sheldon sheldon	
sheldon	
yes	
where are my clothes	
your clothes yes, i left them in the washers	
and when i went down to get them, they were gone	
really	
despite the sign that says "do not leave laundry unattended"	
sheldon, where are my clothes	
you know, i do recall seeing some female undergarments	
where was that	
oh, yes	
earlier this evening,	
i happened to gaze out the window	
and a brassiere caught my eye	
do those look familiar	
how the hell did you get them up on that telephone wire	
when you understand the laws of physics, penny,	
anything is possible	
and may i add mwuhhaha	
get them down	
apologize	

well, then may i suggest you get a very long stick and play panty pinata	
look, wait, sheldon, this has gotten out of hand, okay	
i've done some stupid things	
you've done some stupid things	
how about we just call it even and move on with our lives	
i've done no stupid things	
look, you've got to meet me halfway here	
i am meeting you halfway	
i'm willing to concede that you've done stupid things	
hey, you guys are talking again good	
what happened	
leonard, remember when i said it was on	
well, now it's junior rodeo on	
oh, not junior rodeo	
what did you do	
i had no choice, leonard	
she ruined laundry night	
mwuhhaha	
telephone wires can't electrocute you, can they	
no look, this has to stop	
oh, no, no, no it is just beginning	
all right, i really didn't want to do this, but	
here	
what's this	
sheldon's kryptonite	
oh, my god	
he can never know that i gave that to you	
look, i said i wanted to hurt him, but	
but this	
it'll shorten the war by five years	
and save millions of lives	
oh, pause it that's it confirmed	
we now have the address of the top model house	
god bless you, google street view registered trademark	
okay, for the record,	
what you're doing is really creepy	
you know what if it's "creepy" to use the internet, military satellites, and robot aircraft to find a house full of gorgeous young models	
so that i can drop in on them unexpectedly,	
then fine, i'm "creepy"	
hello	
oh, hi yeah, hold on a second i'll get him	
sheldon, it's for you	
who is it your mother	
oh, good	
hi, mom how are you	
but, mom	
she keeps sitting in my spot	
andand she touched my food	
okay, yes, i took her clothes, but she started it	
no, that's not fair	
why should i have to apologize	
yeah, i really don't think this is the kind of thing	
jesus concerns himself with	
no, you're right	
i don't really know what jesus thinks about	
all right, goodbye	
did you tell on me	
are you kidding me	
i already have two strikes	
penny penny	
penny	
i am very, very sorry for what i have done	
here's your laundry	
i rescind your strikes	
and you are no longer banished
