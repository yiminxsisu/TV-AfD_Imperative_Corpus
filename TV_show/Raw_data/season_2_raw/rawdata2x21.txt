are you from the star wars universe	
were you in the original trilogy	
yes	
is there a picture of you in my wallet wearing a metal bikini	
god, i hope not	
and no, i'm not princess leia	
okay my turn	
are you in all six star wars movies	
yes	
interesting	
are you a droid	
do you kind of look like a shiny sheldon	
cpo	
you got it	
that's preposterous	
i do not resemble cpo	
don't get me wrong	
i'm flattered i just don't see it	
leslie winkle	
you've reached "friends with benefits" for a booty call,	
press one now	
what exactly does that expression mean,	
"friends with benefits"	
does he provide her with health insurance	
imagine you maintained a friendship with someone you had sex with,	
but you were free to date whoever you wanted	
i'm sorry	
i can't imagine any of that	
all right back to the game	
i believe it's my turn	
you may begin your questions	
whenever you're ready	
are you spock	
i don't like this game	
so, where were we	
aren't you leaving for your booty call	
no, it was something else	
why does everything have to be about sex with you come on whose turn is it	
we were up to you	
great just start	
let's see are you from a tv series	
she dumped me	
i bet he's someone from babylon	
we're never going to get it	
what happened	
why did she dump you	
i don't know she just said,	
"howard, mama's a rolling stone"	
then her call waiting beeped	
and she was gone	
i don't understand	
if you were in a nonemotional relationship,	
then why are you having what appears to be an emotional response	
he obviously had feelings for her	
of course i had feelings for her	
i saw her naked, for god's sake	
okay, you just need to get your mind off it	
do you want to go to the comic book store	
maybe go see a movie	
i don't want to go anywhere	
you know,	
i'm given to understand that there's an entire city in nevada designed specifically to help people like howard forget their problems	
they can replace them with new problems, such as alcoholism, gambling addiction, and sexually transmitted diseases	
is it me, or was that sheldon's way of saying, "vegas, baby"	
i've never been there have you	
me no	
i just got "vegas, baby" from vince vaughn in swingers	
it could be fun	
my weekend's wide open, now that	
okay, let's do this	
let's go to las vegas	
now right now	
why not people do things "right now,"	
all the time	
why can't we be "right now" people, too	
go home, pack a bag, and we'll be "right now" people	
i have to stop at the drug store to refill a prescription,	
but after that, we'll go right now	
what do you say, howard	
i say	
"vegas, baby"	
what are you gonna tell your mother	
"sea world, baby"	
are you coming	
i'd rather have a blowfly lay eggs	
and hatch larvae	
in my auditory canal	
great	
we'll bring you back a tshirt	
thank you	
hello, neighbor	
hello, sheldon	
and how are you this fine evening	
great	
good i'm glad	
really	
are you drunk	
i'm just in a good mood	
while my compatriots are in las vegas,	
i will be enjoying a blissful evening in my personal fortress of solitude	
that's superman's big ice thingy, right	
you know, i'm in such a good mood,	
i'm actually finding your tenuous grasp of the english language folksy and charming today	
what smells so good	
that is the intoxicating aroma of kadhai paneer,	
a perfect culinary representation of the freedom this evening holds	
not only is it indian cuisine, which koothrappali loathes,	
it contains a generous helping of peanuts, which would reduce wolowitz to a wheezing pound blister	
and finally, its main ingredient is paneer, a farmer's cheese that would cause leonard to render	
any room uninhabitable within minutes	
yum	
well, enjoy your big evening	
i realize you're also on your own tonight,	
so if, at some point, you find yourself with nothing to do,	
please do not disturb me	
have fun, sheldon	
i shall	
what's wrong, superman	
locked out of your big ice thingy	
look at this	
mouthwash, lotion, body wash shampoo and conditioner together in one tiny bottle	
i love las vegas	
howard, could i borrow some aftershave	
black case, top compartment	
that's a lot of cologne	
first row are your musks	
second is woods, leathers and botanicals	
third is assorted pheromones tread lightly	
that's the spirit, howard	
yes, we can	
let's go	
you guys go ahead	
i just have to finish up an email	
that's not an email	
that's leslie's facebook page	
okay, fine	
i'm checking her facebook page	
look at her status update	
she's saying she dumped me	
people need to know i dumped her	
but she did dump you	
grow up, raj there's no place for truth on the internet	
just go	
i'll catch up with you	
all right	
we should have a plan in case one of us gets lucky	
okay, if i get lucky,	
i'll take her to my stately manor outside gotham city, and	
if you get lucky,	
i'll sleep on the moon	
sounds like a plan	
hang on i think the emergency key is around here somewhere	
we have a bowl	
our keys go in a bowl	
you should get a bowl	
so, how did the beautiful mind of sheldon cooper forget his key in the first place	
i left them in the bowl	
i just remembered where the emergency key is	
where	
in your apartment	
what's it doing in my apartment	
i went in there a few weeks ago and you guys weren't home and i forgot it there	
you went in my why would	
what are you saying	
it's not a big deal i was making coffee and i ran out of milk	
you're the milk thief	
leonard said i was crazy,	
but i knew that carton felt lighter	
all right just calm down	
i will call the building manager and he'll come open your door	
eat your dinner here	
while you're waiting	
eat my dinner in your apartment	
why not	
sure why not	
and after the sun's down,	
we can all pile in my pickup and go skinnydipping down at the creek	
'cause today's the day to stop making sense	
thanks	
i'm telling you, leonard	
video slots free drinks brought to us by a bosomy barmaid and all you can eat shrimp or $	
disneyland can suck it	
this is the real happiest place on earth	
dude, check it out	
that's laundry for a month	
hi	
hello	
what's your name	
rajesh ramayan koothrappali	
hello, rajesh ra	
hi, rajesh	
i'm michaela	
hello, michaela	
so, you interested in a little party	
why, yes, i love to party	
party is my middle name	
or, it would be	
if it weren't ramayan	
can i talk to you for a moment	
not now	
michaela's inviting me to a party	
you better call the moon and make sure they have a bed for you	
yeah i really need to talk to you	
excuse me i'll be right back	
don't go anywhere don't move	
just stay the beautiful, unspoiled american flower that you are	
what's wrong with you, dude	
that woman was all up in my jammy	
okay, i hate to break this to you	
and whatever your "jammy" is, but	
i'm pretty sure she's a prostitute	
what	
let me put it this way	
in your entire life, how many gorgeous women have walked straight up to you in a bar and asked if you wanted to party	
maybe i can save her	
maybe, but i'm guessing it'll cost you	
about $ an hour to try	
it was lovely meeting you	
best of luck in your future endeavors	
whatever	
i miss her already	
howard's losing it	
check out his latest twitters	
"i'm at the bottom of a black hole staring into the abyss "my life is meaningless my future is without hope"	
why don't we take him to see the blue man group	
you think that'd help	
usa today calls them "exuberant fun for the whole family"	
i don't know, howard isn't really the family fun kind of guy	
it's too bad he wasn't here for that hooker	
she's exactly his type a hooker	
you know, i bet if we hired her, that would cheer him up	
we're not gonna get wolowitz a hooker	
"i'm so lonely and horny, "i may open this $ jar of peanuts and end it all"	
i suppose it wouldn't hurt to get an estimate	
so how was your day	
are you trying to make small talk	
sweetie, you really don't have to	
no, it's the accepted convention	
how was your day	
they shifted my schedule around at the restaurant,	
so my hours are gonna be	
i'm sorry	
that's not going to interest me at all	
just eat	
hello again	
hi listen	
if you're not busy, we were thinking maybe you could	
we were wondering if you're really a prostitute	
you guys cops	
no	
i'm a prostitute	
okay, great	
the thing is, we've got this friend, and he's kind of down in the dumps and we thought maybe you could cheer him up with sex	
i think she knows what i meant	
how when you beat around the bush	
she's from the mean streets where they shoot from the hip and keep it real	
don't worry	
i can take good care of your friend	
okay, terrific	
listen, is there a way that we can do this	
where he doesn't know that you're a, you know prostitute	
you want the girlfriend experience	
yes yeah, exactly	
the girlfriend experience	
actually,	
if it's not too much to ask,	
could we have the jewish girlfriend experience	
okay, that's question	
you have to guess	
i don't know, sheldon	
are you star wars	
how can one person be a whole movie	
i give up	
can we just do something else	
fine	
i was spock	
are you and leonard friends with benefits	
what	
are you and leonard friends with benefits	
where did that even come from	
did he say we were	
no, leonard said nothing	
but who knows what goes on over here	
when he pretends	
your mail was misdelivered	
just mail, no benefits	
i see	
why are you asking	
i'm curious about the whole social construct on its face, the idea of satisfying one's sexual appetite,	
assuming one is afflicted with such, that seems eminently practical	 what i've observed, however, s howard wolowitz crying like a little girl	
some people just can't handle that kind of relationship	
can you	
excuse me	
are you able to have sex with men without developing an emotional attachment	
i really don't want to talk about this with you	
is this conversation making you uncomfortable	
of course it's making me uncomfortable	
can't you tell	
i really have no idea	
i don't particularly excel at reading facial expressions	
i'm uncomfortable, sheldon	
thank you that's very helpful	
all right, where are these amazing shrimp	
behold	
seriously, you think this is the size of a baby's arm	
a little baby	
i'm going back to the room	
boy, would it maybe kill them to put out a nice brisket	
hi, there howard wolowitz	
esther rosenblatt	
i don't think the manager's coming tonight, so here are you suggesting i sleep on the couch	
it wasn't the first suggestion that came to mind,	
but it's the one i'm going with	
i can't sleep on your couch	
i sleep in a bed	
and given its dimensions, i have  intention of living out snickering's beloved children's book, the tall man from cornwall	
what	
"there was a tall man from cornwall "whose length exceed his bed "my body fits on it, but barely upon it, "there's no room for my big cornish head"	
all right, i will give you my bed	
on one condition	
that you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours	
may i say one last thing	
only if it doesn't rhyme	
all right	
good night	
turnons let me see	
reading a good book in front of the fire, long walks on the beach and getting freaky on the sabbath with a bacon cheeseburger	
really me, too	
oy, gevalt, you're hot	
excuse me for a moment	
how's it going	
cut the crap	
you set this up, didn't you	
she's a hooker, isn't she	
a prostitute, yes	
you already gave her the money	
thank you	
what	
i can't sleep	
maybe that's because your hole is still open	
i'm homesick	
your home is  feet from here	
feet,  lightyears,	
it doesn't matter	
it's in a galaxy far, far away	
damn it	
what do you want me to do	
sing soft kitty	
that's only for when you're sick	
homesick is a type of being sick	
come on, do i really have to	
i suppose we can stay up and talk	
soft kitty	
warm kitty	
little ball of fur	
happy kitty	
sleepy kitty	
sleepy kit	
start over	
soft kitty	
warm kitty	
little ball of fur	
happy kitty	
sleepy kitty	
purr, purr, purr	
thank you for letting me stay here	
you're welcome, sweetie	
okay, i'm sleepy now	
get out	
good you're finally home	
what were you doing at penny's	
well, we had dinner, played some games, and then i spent the night	
you'll be happy to know that i now have a much better understanding of "friends with benefits"
