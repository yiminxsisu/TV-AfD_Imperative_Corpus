smell that	
that's the smell of new comic books	
they're on me today, boys	
you're paying	
have you been selling your sperm again	
no, i'm celebrating	
as we speak,	
the space shuttle is docking at the international space station	
where it will deploy the wolowitz zerogravity waste disposal system	
get over yourself	
it's a hightech toilet	
just think thanks to your hard work,	
an international crew of astronauts will "boldly go where no man has gone before"	
is that supposed to be funny	
i believe it is	
the combination of the star trek reference and the play on words involving	
the doublemeaning of the verb "to go"	
suggests that leonard is mocking your efforts in space plumbing	
okay, make your little jokes,	
but of the four of us, i'm the only one making any realworld contribution to science and technology	
he's right this is an important achievement, for two reasons	
number one	
and, of course, number two	
clever	
playing on the use of cardinal numbers	
as euphemisms for bodily functions	
here, sheldon,	
i pulled the new hellboy for you	
it's mindblowing	
excuse me	
spoiler alert	
i didn't spoil anything	
you told me it's mindblowing	
so, my mind is going into it	
preblown	
and once a mind is preblown,	
it cannot be reblown	
i'm sorry	
said the grinch to christmas	
can i talk to you about something	
what's up	
remember i went out with penny,	
a couple weeks ago	
yeah, vaguely	
sure you remember	
you went to the bar	
and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women	
what about it	
the thing is,	
the date didn't go that well	
too bad	
i guess the thing to do now	
is just pick yourself up,	
dust yourself off,	
forget it and move on	
i can't do that	
why the hell not	
'cause we're going out again tomorrow	
excuse me, stuart	
have you read the new flash	
well, i have	
and it will knock your socks off	
good luck getting them back on	
this is probably my last shot with penny	
and i don't want to screw it up	
nobody wants that	
so, here's my question	
it's the second date,	
you think she'll be expecting things to get physical	
gee	
my initial reaction is "no,"	
but let me think about it	
and get back to you	
so, you'll give me a call	
yeah, or you call me	
great	
or nobody calls anyone	
interesting	
penny's current suitor asking advice from her former suitor	
you know, thanks for closedcaptioning my pain, raj	
hey, wanna make sure	
he gets nowhere with penny	
without jeopardizing your friendship	
with either of them	
i'm listening	
just tell him to do everything	
you've done with her for the last two years	
how's it going	
good, good you	
fine	
can i ask you something	
sure	
you know your friend stuart	
he asked me out again	
and i said yes,	
and then i started thinking	
maybe i should talk to you first about what	
does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends	
'cause you know, you and me	
no, that's the past	
i'm really more of a "right now" kind of guy	
you know, living in the moment	
although i do have to live a little	
in the future, 'cause that's my job	
of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards,	
but those stories often take place in the future	
in conclusion, no,	
it doesn't bother me	
okay, well,	
that's really cool of you	
i wouldn't say cool	
i'd just say "that's leonard"	
in that case, do you mind giving me some advice about stuart	
love to	
he's very shy	
how do i make him feel more comfortable around me	
first of all, don't underestimate the value of discomfort	
really	
stuart thrives under pressure	
that's why he works in a comic book store	
it's stuart	
you're not going to answer it	
he wants to talk about penny	
i don't want to talk about penny	
you're making an assumption	
perhaps the comic book store is on fire	
and he needs your assistance	
why would he call me	
we don't know	
and if you don't answer the phone,	
we can't know	
i'm not answering the phone	
answer the phone, leonard	
there, it went to voice mail	
aren't you going to check our messages	
you have to check your messages	
the living of a message	is one half of a social contract	
which is completed by the checking of the message	
if that contract breaks down, then all social contracts break down	
and we descend into anarchy	
it must be hell inside your head	
at times	
guys, we have a code red	
"code red" the hospital emergency alert,	
the computer worm,	
or the cherryflavored soft drink from the makers of mountain dew	
look, i was going over the schematics on my zerog toilet,	
and i made a teeny tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve	
how teeny tiny	
it's gonna fail	
after about ten flushes	
but the mission is for six months	
see, that's the code red	
it's kind of like a jackinthebox	
no one knows exactly when,	
but at some point something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box	
have you notified nasa	
are you crazy	
what am i gonna say	
"i screwed up your toilet	
and there's gonna be crap floating "all over your nice shiny space station"	
what are you gonna do	
i'm gonna figure out how to fix it,	
then i'll tell them	
so, what do you need us for	
he can't figure out how to fix it	
you said you were gonna be supportive	
i'm trying, but you have to admit	
this is pretty damn funny	
i agree	
it's the juxtaposition of the hightech	
nature of space exploration	
against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet	
that provides the comic fodder here	
check your messages	
all right,	
this is an exact duplicate of the wolowitz zerogravity	
human waste disposal system	
as deployed on the international space station	
don't you mean the wolowitz zerogravity	
human waste distribution system	
good one	
it's hilarious now	
here's an approximation of the spare parts available on the space station	
we gotta find a way using nothing but this,	
to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine	
you mean so it doesn't hit the fan	
i have to say,	
i thought the toilet humor would get less funny with repetition	
apparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop	
you busy	
classified, leonard	
yeah, it's a regular	
manhattan project	
what's up	
tonight's my date with penny	
and since we haven't been able to connect by phone	
i'm sorry, it's been broken	
or email	
yeah, that too everything's broken	
anyway, i was just wondering	
if you had any lastminute advice	
all right, well,	
off the top of my head,	
i think the most important thing with penny is to go really slow	
i mean, glacial	
guys come onto her all the time,	
so, you need to set yourself apart	
be a little shy,	
don't make too much eye contact	
and, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment	
and and, you know, fear	
fear	
yeah, like,	
you're afraid	
that if you touch her, she'll break	
well, that plays	
right into my wheelhouse	
good, good	
you kids have fun tonight	
thanks, leonard	
what is that thing anyway	
you don't know what this is	
good get out	
be afraid of penny	
nice very crafty	
it wasn't bad advice	
it's just wasn't particularly helpful for what it's worth, my mother says	
that when we deceive	
for personal gain,	
we make jesus cry	
all right, what if we use	
this twoinch pvc	
to reinforce the center crosssupport	
no good	
it might work for the japanese	
and the americans,	
but have you seen the size of the russians they got up there	
this thing has to hold up against a hearty potatobased diet	
i feel terrible	
maybe if you were helping,	
you'd feel better about yourself	
i deliberately tried to sabotage stuart's date with penny	
of course you feel terrible	
you completely screwed up your karma	
you don't really believe in that superstition, do you	
it's not superstition	
it's practically newtonian for every action,	
there's an equal and opposite reaction	
leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a twofaced bitch	
therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug	
it's actually a very elegant system	
you know, what goes around comes around	
speaking of what goes around	
comes around	
okay, look	
instead of trying to reinforce	
this structure here,	
what if we just ran another line,	
bypass it entirely	
it won't work the diameter of the tubing is insufficient	
what if we reposition the collection tank	
it won't work no way to mount it	
okay, here's an idea	
what if i change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband, avi, in israel	
that could work	
morning	
morning what's up	
nothing we just pulled an allnighter	
trying to fix a zerogravity	
pasta maker	
i'm gonna make a coffee run	
do you want any	
no, thanks i have coffee	
great so how'd it go	
with stuart last night	
i really don't want	
to talk about it	
yeah right sure	
the thing is,	
before you guys went out,	
i spoke to him and	
i said i don't want	
to talk about it	
i just i kind of	
what goes on between me and stuart	
is none of your business	
so just leave it alone, okay	
if you want to clean up your karma,	
go get my freakin' latte	
hang on, i think i've got this	
help me see if we can wedge	
this little piece of pvc	
behind the support rod	
you're overestimating	
the tensile strength of the substructure you're building	
sheldon, i know what i'm doing	
if you knew what you were doing,	
there wouldn't be a space toilet	
where my coffee table should be	
howard, wait	
why don't you use this	
instead of the pvc	
to keep the transverse	
filter assembly in place	
because this is not a spare part from the space station	
this is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese	
that what that's for	
in india, the lid touches the cheese	
of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera,	
so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie	
where are you going	
comic book store	
an excellent idea	
i could certainly use a break	
me, too	
you can go to the comic book store	
when man can once again safely poop in space	
why does leonard get to go	
'cause he's upset	
over his situation with penny	
and if i have to hear about it again,	
i'm going to kick him in his ovaries	
thanks for understanding, howard	
i got your back, sister	
all right, i think we've got	
a prototype ready to test	
hand me that tupperware	
that's heavy	
damn right it's heavy	
it's my mother's meat loaf	
it's been testing toilets	
for generations	
i must say,	
i think a detailed letter to mit describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master's degree	
okay, simulated zerogravity	
human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in	
three, two, one	
fascinating	
what do you think the problem is	
not enough bread crumbs	
hey, stuart, i need to talk to you	
sure, what's up	
i gave you bad advice about penny,	
and i want to apologize	
no, your advice was great	
it was	
yeah, going slow really worked	
you're kidding	
never worked for me	
last night at dinner,	
i did what you told me	
i went really slow,	
i kept my distance,	
and two bottles of wine later, we were making out in my car	
wine i didn't say to give her wine	
it doesn't matter,	
that's where it all went to hell	
during the kissing	
what did you do, sneeze in her mouth	
i did that to a girl once	
no, everything was good	
and really hot	
and i said,	
"oh, penny,"	
and right where she was supposed to say,	
"oh, stuart," she said	
your name	
that is your name, right	
i'm sorry that must've been the last thing you wanted to hear	
it beats, "you know i'm a dude, right"	
yeah, it was pretty bad	
no doubt, no doubt	
i'm sorry it didn't work out	
not your fault	
yeah, how about that	
see you soon	
sure	
yes, sir, i understand "classified"	
we'll keep it all classified	
no one has to know but you and me	
what's classified	
howard's space toilet	
i'll tell you later	
well, they've deployed our solution	
let's just all hope it works	
i don't see why i have to worry	
my career's not hanging in the balance	
that was a joke	
it's funny,	
because it's true	
leonard, could you pass the soy sauce, please	
i'm sorry, were you talking to me	
yeah, i said "leonard"	
yes, you did, didn't you	
what the hell is that	
meatloaf	
what was it doing on the ceiling	
that's classified	
houston, international space station	
we have a little situation up here	
we'd like to make an unscheduled space walk	
iss, houston	
which crew members would be involved in this eva	
houston, we'd all like	
to step outside for a few minutes	
iss, i'm afraid we can't authorize that	
houston, this is more of an fyi call	
we are basically out the door
