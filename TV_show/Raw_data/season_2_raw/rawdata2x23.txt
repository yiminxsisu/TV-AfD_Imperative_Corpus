oh, boy	
what	
i can't comment	
without violating our agreement	
that i not criticize your work	
then what was "oh, boy"	
great restraint on my part	
there's nothing wrong with the science here	
perhaps you mean a different thing	
than i do when you say, "science"	
how's that	
you actually had it right in the first place	
once again, you've fallen for one of my classic pranks	
bazinga	
now here's a peculiar email the president of the university wants me to meet him at his office tomorrow morning at  am	
why	
it doesn't say	
it must be an emergency	
everyone at the university knows i eat breakfast at	
and move my bowels at	
yes, how did we live before twitter	
i guess you'll find out	
what it is in the morning	
that's  hours away	
for the next  minutes,	
i'm effectively one of heisenberg's particles	
i know where i am	
or i know how fast i'm going,	
but i can't know both	
yet how am i supposed to carry on	
with this huge annoying thing hovering over my head	
i know the feeling	
sheldon, it's  in the morning	
why does everybody keep telling me	
what time it is	
everybody	
you, the president of the university,	
his wife,	
their sullen teenage daughter	
that entire family is fascinated by what time it is	
and whether people know it	
you went to president seibert's house	
in the middle of the night	
he didn't respond to my email,	
his phone number is unlisted	
tell me what my other option was	
you could have waited until morning	
i know, look who i'm talking to	
do you remember	
the grant proposal i submitted to the national science foundation to detect slowmoving monopole at the magnetic north pole	
hardly a day goes by when i don't think about it	
how nice	
well, a space opened up	
at the last minute on the nsf	
expedition to the arctic circle	
wait a minute	
he offered to send you to the north pole	
in fact, he was quite enthusiastic	
he said, "frankly,	
if i could send you tonight, i would"	
okay, well, do you want to go	
of course not	
i'm a theoretical physicist	
a career i chose in no small part	
because it's indoors,	
but if i'm able to detect	
slowmoving magnetic monopoles there,	
i will be the scientis	
to confirm string theory	
people will write books about me	
thirdgraders will create	
macaroniart dioramas	
depicting scenes from my life	
sure, maybe a tableau of me	
trying to pummel you to death	
sarcasm	
maybe	
i'm on the horns of a dilemma	
can you imagine me, sheldon	
cooper, at the north pole	
easy peasy, i'm doing it right now	
i'm not good with cold	
how often have we had to leave a movie theater	
because i got a headache from drinking the icee too fast	
i can't go	
then don't go	
how can you say that	
the scientific opportunity	
of a lifetime	
presents itself	
and my best friend says "don't go"	
all right, then go	
listen to you	
how can i possibly go	
what are the words	
i can say right now	
to end this conversation	
and let me go back to sleep	
odd, president seibert posed the exact same question	
how was it resolved	
it wasn't	
his wife set their dogs on me and rendered the question moot	
just imagine	
if he says yes,	
we'll have an entire summer	
without sheldon	
we could play outside	
we could sit on the left side of the couch	
i could use the bathroom at	
our dreams are very small,	
aren't they	
good news, gentlemen,	
i have tentatively accepted	
the invitation to join	
the arctic expedition	
it's not gonna be the same without you	
thank you,	
but your sentiments may be premature	
i don't like where this is going	
i would like to propose	
that the three of you accompany me to the north pole	
is this just so we won't touch	
your stuff while you're away	
i'll admit that was a concern	
but the fact is,	
i'll need a support team	
and the three of you	
are my first choice	
really	
there are others who might be more qualified,	
but the thought of interviewing them	
gave me a stomachache	
i know i'm proposing	
an enormous undertaking	
so, why don't you take a few moments to discuss it	
we're not really gonna go to the north pole with him, are we	
i'm still within earshot	
you may want to wait for my door to close	
we're not really gonna go	
to the north pole with him, are we	
hang on let's talk about it	
this is a national science	
foundation expedition	
i don't know how	
we can turn it down	
easy instead of saying, "no, we	
don't want to go on an nsf expedition,"	
say, "no, we don't want to spend	
"three months stuck in a cabin in	
the arctic circle with an anal nutbag"	
but if we were part of the team	
that confirmed string theory,	
we could drink for free	
in any bar in any college town	
with a university	
that has a strong science program	
howard, this is big science	
you could be the engineer	
who builds the equipment	
that puts us on the cover of magazines	
i could also be the engineer	
who builds the crossbow	
that kills sheldon	
you still might get on a magazine	
so you guys are seriously	
considering this	
you think you can put up with sheldon	
well, i'm a hindu	
my religion teaches	that if we suffer in this life	
we are rewarded in the next three months at the north pole with sheldon,	
and i'm reborn as a wellhung	
billionaire with wings	
well, gentlemen,	
have you reached a decision	
i'm in	
me, too	
damn it peer pressure fine	
excellent	
just an fyi, as i am the expedition's team leader, protocol dictates that be phrased, "fine, sir"	
but don't worry,	
there will be a briefing	
what do you want	
i need access to the cheesecake	
factory's walkin freezer	
honey, i already told you,	
the hamburger meat is fresh	
and stored at a safe temperature	
this is to train	
for a threemonth expedition	to the magnetic north pole	
what	
i don't know how that sentence could possibly confuse you	
but to elaborate,	
i'm going to the arctic circle	
with leonard, wolowitz	
and koothrappali	
you're all going	
yes	
for three months	
yes	
excuse me	
is that a yes or a no	
on the freezer	
that woman has the attention span of a gnat	
sheldon says you're going	
to the north pole	
pretty cool, huh	
yeah i'm just a little surprised	
you didn't tell me	
it all happened kind of fast	
and we had to get physicals and buy thermal underwear and study up on, you know, snow and stuff	
sorry, i was gonna tell you	
you don't have to apologize	
there's no reason you have to tell me	
i was just	
you know, surprised	
you were busy, you were surprised,	
all very fascinating	
now where do we stand	
on the freezer	
is he serious	
actually, it would help	
all right, i'll see what i can do	
so, three months at the north pole	
that is awesome	
i'm sorry, but at what point	
do you put this "see what you can do" plan into action	
just a warning, sheldon	
the freezer locks from the outside	
did she seem upset to you	
did she seem upset to you	
good, i got it right	
are you upset	
a little bit	
two for two i'm on fire	
i know she's not	
my girlfriend or anything,	
but wouldn't you think	
she'd feel a little bad that i'm going to be gone	
for the whole summer	
that feels like a bonus question	
i'm going to stop here while i'm ahead,	
but i've had a great time	
all right,	
the purpose of this drill	
is to acclimate us	
to the use of tools	
in extreme temperatures	
such as we will face	
in the arctic circle	
where are your tools	
right here	
all right, team,	
open up your practice kits	
as the university did not permit me	
to bring the actual equipment	
we'll be using	
to the cheesecake factory,	
because apparently,	
i'm "ridiculous,"	
i've provided substitutes which	
will exercise your fine motor skills	
leonard, you will be doing a series of complex mathematical problems on a vintage casio model	
calculator watch i received	
when i won the earth science medal	
in rd grade	
treat it with respect	
raj, you will be painting sideburns and a van dyke on a sixinch figurine of legolas the elf	
now, remember, a van dyke	
is a goatee without a mustache	
wolowitz, you will be completing a series of delicate surgical procedures	on the classic children's game	"operation"	
to begin with, you will "remove funny bone for two hundred dollars"	
for this i went to mit	
and begin	
i think i swallowed some paint	
i can't press	
any of the buttons with my gloves	
son of a bitch	
adversity is to be expected	
continue	
oh, boy, am i gonna get sued	
okay, i can't do this	
me either	
gentlemen, use your imagination	
innovate	
did han solo let luke skywalker freeze	
to death on the ice planet of hoth	
he cut open a tauntaun	
and used its internal body heat	
to warm him up	
you heard the man	
hold him down and i'll cut him open	
hang on, i know i don't possess	
the tools of leadership,	
but why can't we assemble the equipment	
inside the hut and then take it outside	
i hadn't thought of that	
i guess we're done here	
here,	
drink slash eat this	
what is it	
hot chocolate with a stick of butter	
okay, why in the frigid temperatures in the arctic,	
we need to consume at least calories a day	
just to maintain our body weight	
you know i can't eat butter	
i'm lactose intolerant	
way ahead of you, that's an "i can't believe it's not butter" stick	
but mummy, all the other guys are going to the north pole	
i don't care what the other guys are doing	
if the other guys jumped	
in the bay of bengal	
and tried to swim to sri lanka,	
would you follow them	
if you were standing behind me nagging, i might	
don't talk back to your mother	
this trip is much too dangerous	
no, it's not	
howard, tell them	
doctor and mrs koothrappali,	
namaste	
i understand your concern,	
but if it'll make you feel any better,	
my mother is fine with me going,	
and it's a woman who kept a safety rail	
on my bed until i was	
so, she has no problem with her son being eaten by a walrus	
that's very unlikely,	
mrs koothrappali	
if raj dies,	
it'll be from frostbite,	
gangrene, acute sunburn	
or being ripped to shreds	
by a , pound polar bear	
ma, i'm putting you on speakerphone	
with raj's parents	
can you tell them that you're okay	
with me going to the arctic	
arctic	
i thought you said arkansas	
i didn't say that	
you never listen to me	
he doesn't tell me anything	
he lives a secret life	
because he's ashamed	
can i talk to you for a sec	
sure, but let's go out here	
where there's a little less yelling and guilt	
what's up	
well, i got you	
a little going away present	
a blanket	
no, not just a blanket	
see, it has sleeves	
so, you can be all snoodled up	
while you do your science stuff	
cool	
i'm gonna miss you	
see you later	
bye	
i told you no	
why don't you believe me	
'cause it doesn't make sense to me	
how can it be	
that in the entire country of india, there isn't one outback steakhouse	
i want a cookie, meemaw	
it's me	
but meemaw just made cookies	
i don't know if i can go on the expedition	
what	
i don't think i can go to the north pole	
i know you're concerned about disappointing me	
but i want you to take comfort	
from the knowledge	
that my expectations	
of you are very low	
yeah, that's very comforting	
comforting is a part of leadership	
it's not a part i care for,	
but such is my burden	
terrific, it's just that i don't think penny wants me to go	
assuming that's a valid reason	
not to go, which it isn't	
how do you know this	
did she say it	
not exactly	
but she said she was gonna miss me	
and she gave me this	
what is it	
it's a blanket with sleeves	
that's clever	
let me see	
if i understand correctly	
her missing you is an emotional state you find desirable	
yes, obviously	
well, given that missing you is predicated on you leaving,	
logic dictates you must leave	
yes, okay, but i'm gonna be gone for three months	
what if she doesn't miss me that long	
and she meets someone else	
she does have a short attention span	
so, i can't go	
leonard, you may be right	
it appears that penny	
secretly wants you in her life	
in a very intimate and carnal fashion	
you really think so	
of course not	
even in my sleepdeprived state,	
i've managed to pull off another one of my classic pranks	
bazinga	
what time is it	
it's  am i'm sorry it's early,	
but we're leaving soon,	
and i needed to talk to you	
what did you mean when you said	
you were going to miss me	
i don't know	
you'll be gone and i'll notice	
what about this	
what does this mean	
wine, credit card and late night television	
are a bad combination	
all right, fine	
what about that really long hug	
what did that mean	
that wasn't a long hug	
it was at least five mississippis	
a standard hug is	
two mississippis tops	
leonard, i don't know what to tell you	
it was just a hug	
glad we cleared that up	
yeah	
i guess i'll see you	
okay, have a safe trip	
thank you	
bye	
okay, bye	
it means i wish you weren't going	
damn it	
what	
we're out of ice	
all right, we begin initial assembly	
and deployment of the testing equipment	
starting tomorrow at  hours,	
but until then,	
you are all off duty	
i suggest you keep the shenanigans to a minimum	
as medical help is	
hours away by dogsled	
what are you working on	
crossbow	
hey, guys, can i just say something	
how about we take a moment to think about where we are right now	
this is literally the top of the world	
only a handful of people in all of human history will ever see what we are going to see	
he's right	
it is remarkable	
so, who's up for a movie	
good idea, what do you think	
ice station zebra	
or john carpenter's the thing	
i say double feature	
dinner's ready	
what are we having	
reconstituted thai food	
did you bring the dehydrated	
lowsodium soy sauce	
freezedried spicy mustard	
check	
flashfrozen brown rice, not white	
sorry	
not to worry	
i hid it	
bazinga	
you're in my spot	
there's no time for a crossbow	
find me an icicle	
three months	
this is gonna be great
